"{\"So how are you doing?\": \"Im pretty good.\", \"Ok well  so please tell me about yourself.\": \"ok  uhm  so have you looked at my resume or should I  alright  so I guess ah  I am course 6-7 here at M.I.T  ah which is computational biology  so its a mix of computers  science and biology and actually thats where my interest lie in applying like algorithmic kinda software engineering too datasets dealing with genomics and biology.  Uhm some of that activities that you do out side of school  include Camp Kesem which is a summer camp that we run for completely free for kids whose parents have cancer  as well as ah amphibious achievement  which is ah a high school tutoring program for inner city kids in Boston  \", \" mhhmm\": \"So ah  my interest kinda laid both in a little bit of the health care  I imagined I was going be a Doctor growing up  and then it came down to the tee and Im like  well I can do engineering and still apply and do the same things and help a lot more people.\", \"So please tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Ok  uhm  one of the things we have to do for Camp Kesem is orgin or fundraise all the money to ah  to  run the camp which is over $50 000.00.  Ah so one of the things that I individually spearhead every year is called the Camp Kesem I say you did auction  where actually my fraternity and I go out and solicit uhm  donations in the form of gift cards  ah to raise money for a date auction where we actually sell dates  and then we use this money obviously we donate it to Camp Kesem. I spearhead the entire event and I kinda orginize everyone into committees and groups  and I send the people out and make sure everything goes according to plan.  \", \"Tell me about a time when your working on a team and faced with a challenge  how did you solve that problem?\": \" Ahh  I guess the easiest team project I just I just had  was  last semester  uhm I worked on this six double o five project which is algorithm or software architecture.\", \" uh hun.\": \"and we were put in a group of 3 people  and it was standard you know we signed the contract everyone is supposed to work equally  but it ended up being by the end of it  that someone didn't like put there fair share of work in...Ah essentially we talked to him we didn't really get it out  we actually had to go to some of the T.A's we got a little bit ah  and that kinda like pushed him forward  so I mean I guess what I am showing is like  Im not affraid to go to the right method or like authority like where in cases this situation presents itself.  \", \"Oh yes.  Alright tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.\": \" Uhmmm.  I would say for this job  ah Im a little technically underprepared.  Ah I've yet  I have only taken the introductory software classes so far and as well as introductory bio classes  but I think just from sheer interest and sheer effort i will be able to kinda overcome these obstacles.\", \" Now why do you think we should hire you?\": \" Ah  Im very interested  in the subject of computation biology  and I think that I will be able to contribute a lot to this field  uhm I've had a good amount of experience and I think I will be a solid intern.\", \"Well thank you.\": \". Um how they can just um  ya know  get better so quickly compared to adults. um and I want to I guess   um bring the knowledge that i gained from MIT um into the medical fiwld. Um \", \"So  how you doing?\": \"I'm a little [???] by the resurgence of the hurricane  but..\", \"I'm okay.\": \"\", \"I understand  I got to get home later too and I'm worried.\": \"Yeah  we were half way here and it just turned on a switch  lightening  winds and everything.\", \"Oh wow.\": \"Umm  so umm again  in the robotics project uhh competition at Cambridge umm in in our team of six I had to  in some ways  help out and direct the design choices in our  umm  for the competition. Uhh some things include deciding which sensors to be placed and where and kind of the overall idea was basically because I am running the AI  I have to umm have a clear idea of what the robot has to do  what its components are and I was the one to be the go-to guy in case somebody had to make the decision up based on that. And I made decisions uhh just based on rationality where umm if something was  the idea was that something has to be umm only as complicated as it needs to be and no more complicated because any more complications make problems  stuff doesn't work  breaks  umm so yeah. And I also helped out with the electronics and sometimes the woodshure which umm sensors to hook up to which control lines and stuff like that and I had to blast them on umm well what I wanted to be done for the AI to work properly. Umm another case of leadership  I guess  was I did military service in Finland uh uhh as a citizen-\", \"So  uh  tell me about yourself.\": \"Okay  um  I'm a Junior here at MIT  um  I'm studying aerospace engineering  um  my  my interests are generally in food mechanics  control  um  design  um  mostly aircraft  but protozoan [???] problems in general. Um  I like to  um  I like to play music  listen to music  um  I run  do some other team sports  I like to play hockey. \", \"Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Uh  which was awesome because  like  they have a ton of money\", \"Okay.\": \"e been able to communicate more  more then some  we definitely  we definitely have a  long way to go but we're increasing communication uh  right now and uh  we're doing much better. And we're making a lot of progress now.\", \"Mm-hmm.\": \"Um  so yeah definitely  I feel like  I like working with teams  I like people. I work with um  and example related to a class I took. I don\\u2019t remember the name of it exactly  but it was something related to mobile development. We had to make an app as part of the class and one of our ideas was that if you have the I-phones and you could kind of bump the two of them together. It was kind of a novel idea in relation to what everyone else was doing in terms of photo sharing and meeeting friends. I was required with the technical expertise. There was this new thing that was developed at MIT\\u2019s regional lab called SWIPE which I had basically allowed you to swipe from one phone to another for data sharing. It was to get data across. It wasn\\u2019t really what we wanted  but we thought it was a good start. A couple of members on my team knew the people that started it and one girl on my team was particular gung ho about it  um  the four the us. One guy was experienced and super excited to be trying new stuff. Another experienced programmer was relatively alright with this  and then there was me who was sort of relatively alright. Um  and there was someone else who was a freshman at the time and she was basically ok with every idea that we said. \", \"Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem?\": \"Okay  um  so  another  another thing that I spend a lot of my time doing is called  is an organization called Design  Build  Fly here  um  it's  it's a design competition um  run by the IAA  which is an aerospace professional organization.  And um   and uh  you can enter a team from any university or group  basically anywhere in the world. It's mostly US university though.\", \"Sure.\": \" my teammate was playing not as well. And it was a pressured situation. And we have  you have a break in between  2 1/2 half hours. And the rest of the team was doing pretty well but she wasn't. And they were sort of pressuring her to do better. And I sort of said  Well  guys like it's going to make her do worse  you know  so let up. And we joked around and that really helped resolve the conflict. So  I think it's important to like understand that the angle is more important than your own personal goal like winning this trophy. It's more important to be like be cohesive and  function as a unit.\", \"Mm-hmm. Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.\": \"Okay  um  so one of my  I think definitely since coming here  I've noticed that one of my biggest weaknesses is written communication. Um  I really was not intimidated by the thought of it in high school  but I um  definitely since coming here  I find that perhaps um at the expense of technical skills  my written communication skills have atrophied  maybe is the right word. And  um  so I definitely  I think I'm um  pretty aware of this and um  and um.. I would definitely like to improve it and um...\", \"Now why do you think that we should hire you for this position?\": \"Okay  um  I  um  I mean  I think  I don't know what this position that it is...\", \"Whatever position you want at a company that you're looking for.\": \"Yeah  sure  but if I knew that this position was  I think that I would want it because um  this is really what I thrive off of. I  um  enjoy doing it  um  and I would be excited to come to work every day to do it. Um  which  um  that's like the biggest thing for me. I um  I would be excited to come do it and I know I would put my  you know  put my all into doing a good job at it  because I would be excited to come do it. And  um  I think that um  I have a decent skill set to do this and I think that I'm qualified to contribute in this area.\", \"Mm-hmm. Well thank you.\": \"Uhh  I\\u2019m a junior at MIT  uhh I\\u2019m double majoring in Management and Biology  er  I\\u2019m very interested in the world of finance  uh  business  consulting all of those sorts of things. Um  so I\\u2019ve tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh  those sort of roles in the business world. Outside of school  I enjoy running  cross-country and track  I\\u2019m on the varsity team at MIT. And umm  I\\u2019m also very involved in Greek Life at MIT  so I\\u2019m on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming  and also hold a leadership position in my sorority. \", \"So  tell me about yourself. \": \"Okay  I'm from Siokee.\", \"Great  okay. Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Umm  so I guess this past semester actually  I\\u2019m associate advisor for umm  freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor  and er   the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all  er  were very uhh  set on our ideas. So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together . Um  so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first  \\u2018cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from. But after that  and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be  we eventually figured out what we wanted to do. \", \"Great. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge. How did you guys overcome that?\": \"Uhh  yeah so  we had \\u2014 we were trying to communicate via email at first  so I think that was  uhh inefficient  especially since we had only met in a group once before  umm so meeting in person and really  trying to outline not just like   what the event was going to be  what our purpose of the event was going to be  and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen. I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event  we were able to build it up from there. \", \"Can you be more specific about that  what you eventually figured out?\": \"Umm  so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking  actually  and uhh  I think by taking a variety of classes  especially this one class that I\\u2019m in  that focuses on management and communication . I\\u2019ve been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches  uhh  and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what I\\u2019m saying  which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general. I think I\\u2019ve been able to build up my confidence and know like  how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better. \", \"Okay  so can tell me about some of your weakness? Do you have any idea? \": \"Uhh  I think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience  umm would allow me to perform well on the job. I think  I\\u2019ve worked umm  both individually in a project as well as in a team-focused environment  which umm  I think is key for consulting and investment banking positions. I also feel that my MIT background  uh  the quantitative analysis that I\\u2019ve done in classes  as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well  so\\u2026\", \"Great. So why do you think we should hire you?\": \"I'm good  how are you?\", \"Great.\": \": So  um  and he really wanted to use it. But  after a few tries he realized it wasn\\u2019t working. And  we went back to the people who made sky- uh  SWIPE  and they said maybe it\\u2019s not read for production yet  and maybe you should stop using. While the other member of my team still wanted to keep using it. Um  we had to sit back  but we had to still complete the project  so um we had to deal with somehow understanding where he comes from  and we had to sort of do something about it. We had a meeting that resolved it  um  and we had to sort of say  \\u201cthis is why we think SWIPE is cool  but this is also why we think we should not use it.\\u201d We had to complain that  um  that link is like swipe  but it would not do what we needed it to. Over a series of meetings  he came to realize that um  it evolved  that you know  um  we had to stick to the group. And we would say something like  \\u201cmaybe you could do this link real quick for me \\u201d and he had to realize  like  \\u201cmaybe I can.\\u201d (laughter). So  he was like  it was a very short time to get him to sort of fix it. \", \"So how are you doing today?\": \" I think I would know my limits a little bit better. Um  in that sense I  like I mentioned with the computer science and management I get excited in a lot of different areas and I really want to try doing everything that excites me and I really give it my all  but as a result being involved with a lot of different things means that at times I very tired because I'm trying to do a lot so I think I would recognize when I'm hitting that point and scale back a little bit um that said  I've been trying to work on that a bit this year and kind of pick my top activities and cut down to those so it is something I'm working on.\", \"Good. So  why don't you tell me about yourself?\": \"Ok  umm  I'm currently a junior at M.I.T. studying electrical engineering and computer science. Umm  I first became interested in engineering in high school  I guess  when I worked in a lab at  a material science lab  at U.C. Berkley. Umm  and since then I've worked at a variety of different places including labs and at  uh  and in the industry including electrical engineering labs here  and at Standford  and umm Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the silicon valley.\", \"Ok. Any extracurriculars  any interests?\": \"Yeah  ok. So  um  in high school I was a life guard. And that's  it was a great job but it was a lot of working with other lifeguards in kind of in a  a team situation. Um  and a lot of the times one person would have to step up in order to be a leader with you know uh like swi-  like we taught swim lessons. And I would have a partner with me and we'd both be teaching the same kids. And  I'd have to  you know  tell them what to do  or tell them what exactly we were going to do during that class. That sort of stuff.\", \"Great. \": \"Um  yeah. So I'm not super great with being organized. Like  I'm alright  but especially with administrative things like paperwork and...uhm  I...I'm good with deadlines  but only if I had set reminders. So like even for example  trying to get into this building today was an adventure or remembering to fill out all the forms for...like my [xx?] and everything is...it can be sometimes sort of a struggle.\", \"Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"\", \"Ok great. What about  can you tell me about a time you worked on a team  and you had a conflict or challenge  and how you went about solving that.\": \"Uhhhh in high school we would have to work on team projects a lot  ummm I don't know in history class or that kind of a thing  work  working with projects. And sometimes we'd have kids who wouldn't do their home- do  you know their part on time  or people who didn't like they  what they were doing. There was one specific time where we had a conflict where one girl just decided she didn't really want to do you know any of the  any of the project  she wasn't really showing up to class  wasn't doing any of the  any of the stuff she had to so we had to talk to her  and figure out what was going on and kind of resolve the conflict in that way.\", \"Can you be more specific?\": \"In what way? Like -\", \"Like  you  you just spoke with her?\": \"Yeah. So I mean us as a group we met with the teacher umm and told her what was happening. And then \", \"Oh ok  ok. Ok  ok.\": \"The next  the next day when the girl came to class we  you know sat her down  asked her why she wasn't doing the homework. Whatever  that kind of stuff. But it was  it was just a case of high school kids not wanting to do anything. So (laughs).\", \"Right  ok. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Ok ummm  I have a really bad habit of trying to do everything all at once  and I sometimes put too much on my plate. And I recognize that you have to delegate tasks in a group or tell someone when they've given you too much to do. So I think it's kind of  in terms of how I'm trying to improve that  is be realistic with myself on the amount of time I have or what my skills are. And if I need help ask for it or if I need someone to do part of it  ask for it. And early on  not the day before something has to be done  tell them that it's not going to happen.\", \"And last question - why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Ummmm I think you should hire me because your company  ummm is a great  would be a great opportunity for me to learn and improve as an Engineer umm and I think I could just add a lot to the team in general in terms of like  like my wide interests  and  and education background.\", \"How are you doing today?\": \"So  we would not use SWIPE but thought of something that thought pushes and you know.\", \"So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Umm  in high school I was part of the school orchestra and I played bassoon. I was the principle bassoon there. So  that means I was in charge of the bassoon section. So basically  umm  I ran extra  I ran practices for  within our section outside of  uh   when the orchestra would get together and practice.\", \"Mm Hm.\": \"I coordinated that. I also  uh  set up events between the woodwind sections to  uh you know  so people would get to know each other and  you know  we could practice together and things like that.\", \"Great. Ok. Tell me about time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Umm  this past summer I worked in Spain. Umm  in operations research and I was part of a research group there. Umm  it was  so  we had  uh  within our team  it was  communicating with each other was the biggest challenge because my Spanish isn't so great and their English wasn't so great.\", \"Mm hm.\": \"So  umm  what we ended  we basically communicated through like  the papers  through the papers we read  umm  we  well  one thing that helped was  we both got  like everyone  they got better at speaking English  I got better at understanding them. I guess they got better at understanding my Spanish also. So  we were able to communicate by just  you know  talking really slowly  repeating everything a couple times. Umm  we also did a lot of technical things and so those were mostly related to technical papers and things like that. Those were written mostly in English  so that was  that wasn't so much of a problem for me...but...it made it  because they were working in the area already and I was new to the area  looking through these made it easier for me to understand what my role was  what I was supposed to do. Umm  things like that.\", \"Ok  great.  Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you were doing to overcome it?\": \"umm  well  one thing right now is that I can get really hung up on small details and  uh  it becomes a problem because its  it can be distracting and cause me to lose sight of  like  the big picture. But since coming to M.I.T. I've been  I've been involved in a lot of classes  a lot of activites and things and that's forced me to manage my time better.  So  now that  uh  like  I have  because I have a lot of time constraints  I'm forced to finish a project or assignment or whatever  and I can't  I can't get caught up in  like  little things that don't ultimately make a big a difference. So  um  by being forced to manage my time more  I'm  uh  overcoming this problem.\", \"Great  ok. So  why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Well  I have the  I have the quantitative and qualitative skills necessary to accomplish  uh  accomplish project goals and get things done. Uh  I can solve problems and  and can work pretty well in a team.\", \"Ok\": \"I would absolutely consider myself a team player. I care more about people than basically anything else. Conflict? I\\u2019m sorry I am trying to think of a story.\", \"Great!\": \"Hm  well uh I have a lot of experience uh working at the Game Lab here and that coupled with you know what I\\u2019ve learned in classes I think makes me a really good fit for this job. I have  um so when I was working at the Game Lab I worked on many  many projects so pretty much one project a semester and these projects varied widely. They were in different languages  the topics were different. Some were more technical  some weren\\u2019t\\u2019. Some were more fully specified than others. And so given that I\\u2019ve touched upon such a wide range of things  I think that I\\u2019m very adaptable. Uh and also um at this Game Lab  I\\u2019ve worked in lots of teams  so I feel like I have a strong grasp of teamwork and having worked at that Starbucks  I\\u2019ve really learned to deal with all sorts of people so I feel like that\\u2019s a good asset to have for this job.\", \"So  how are you doing today\": \"I'm a student at MIT and Im a junior right now but I'm probably gonna graduate this year.  So  uh  that's kind of exciting at scary at the same time.  Uh  like I said I'm a computer science major so some of the stuff that I'm interested in is computational photography and a lot of graphic stuff.  I've got a bunch of experience with web development mainly  uh front end development so that's uh  I guess where a lot of my experience lies.  \", \"Good. Tell me about yourself.\": \"And I've been interested in medicine my whole life. Um  my dad worked for UCSF...\", \"Great.  Tell me about a time that you demonstrated leadership.\": \" Well  I...so  for one of my classes  we have to  it's a software design class where you have to work with other students.  So  I was assigned two teammates randomly and we had one teammate who really wasn't pulling their weight and wasn't contributing in a way that was you know  fair and even  and so what we ended up doing is  we all thankfully were able to sit down and talk.  We were able to get a hold of her and we realized it was because we were dividing the work in a way that made it really difficult for her  it was not playing off her strengths.  So  we redistributed the work and she was able to do things that were still helpful but played more to her strengths.  \", \"Great.  Alright.  Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge.  How did you overcome that problem.  \": \" Um  I think one of my weaknesses is I'm a perfectionist so when I do work on teams I have trouble sometimes delegating tasks because I want to micromanage and make sure everything is just the way it is.  But what I've done to overcome that is basically just sort of familiarized myself with how to um  like  say no to a task and just kind of  I guess  modualize [sic] projects more.  So  I think I had trouble when I was always thinking big picture and then I would want to look at every single detail i that big picture.  But if I just give myself one part of the project and just  you know  divide it into different modules in my head then I'm able to just  you know  perfect my one part but not so much focus on every little detail.\", \"Great.  Okay.  Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. \": \"Uh  I think that my skill set is pretty unique because I'm both technical and also well-spoken and I'd be able to communicate really well.  And I think it's a unique combination to have both of those skills.\", \"Okay.  And why do you think we should hire you?\": \"I'm doing fine uh  thank you how about you? Um  have you like you know um  the storm  I hope that hasn't like disturbed any power too much. \", \"Okay so how are you doing today? \": \"That's at least very fortunate. \", \"No actually it was fine I was expecting it to be a lot worse. I think a lot of people were a lot worse off than I was. \": \"Um  okay so I'm a current junior at MIT. \", \"Mm-hm. \": \"Um  I think that I can bring I don't know like something  different a new perspective to the table especially coming from MIT. Um  having had like a very quantitative background. \", \"Great so can you tell me about yourself? \": \"Um  I'm also involved in Chinese student club escort culture. So I do a lot of you know pudding on campus for um  events like night market which I worked  I helped organize just last week.\", \"Okay. \": \"So um  it that sort of helps me with communication  my communication skills. You know talking to the officers of other student clubs. \", \"Oh okay. \": \"And one of my assignments was to you know sort of lead uh  sort of like drive the direction of like a research project that they were doing  which was to research um  a generic um  in hopes of releasing it to the market. \", \"Great. So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. \": \"Um  sometime in the future. Because I had  I was partnered up with some a lab partner that was less experienced than I was um  I found myself in many situations having to help guide her along and getting up to speed with the project and the techniques that we needed to do our experiments. \", \"Great  okay. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge and what you did to solve that problem. \": \"Um  are there things that like you feel would make it better. Um  things that you would like to see that you think would make it more effective. \", \"Mm-hm.\": \"Okay so I was born in Irvine  California  um where I lived for about ten years. And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point. So I went to an international school there. Um. It was mostly English speaking  but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends  um  as well as  you know  just getting by in the outside world.\", \"Great all right. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. \": \"And then while I'm thinking about it still I'll like talk more about what's coming to mind. \", \"Alright great and last question. Why do you think we should hire you? \": \"Very good  how are you?\", \"Thank you.\": \"Yes. Um  so I have a weakness for over-committing sometimes  and  uh  what I have been doing in the last year or so  well since I came to MIT  but particularly this year is cutting back on things that don't mean much to me. Cutting back on things that are  that have always just been interest that I never see myself progressing in. So  um  for example  I was  uh  I took a small leadership role in my sorority  like  my  my freshman year  but I wasn't  I don't see myself going very far in leadership in my sorority  so I cut that kind of thing out and I've been focusing on classes  sailing  I'm on the sailing team  and  uh  Amnesty International  and those are my three main focus things  so although  I do do other things. Like I was and orientation leader  um  when I have time I give tours  from  thats my job campus tour guiding  but  um  I've been getting better  I've been staying more on track with classes this way  and  um  having sailing has definitely helped  so a bit of self-discipline-\", \"Great  so how are you doing today?\": \"t I really realized from the whole experience is that leadership also needs to recognizes that you are only a leader for a certain amount of time and you really need to be able to kind of set up a situation in which you can set up so someone can transition into your spot.  I mean especially in a like college setting  you are going to be the president for a year or maybe two years  ummm and I think what we really learned I think a lot of the struggle we learned from last year is to set up that sort of structure. Also last year there was some tension within the group  just because we were like what are we doing  like why aren't we doing anything  there wasn't a lot of transparency so really trying to emphasize that this year. And we were  so I keep saying we  because co-presidents  it\\u2019s my friend Cheri and I  but we are co-presidents  we have been able to expand the club. Last year we had about 14 members  ummm maybe like 10 or less that were truly committed  so now we are at 30 members. Which is a really really exciting thing.\", \"Great  can you tell me a little bit about yourself? \": \"Yea.\", \"Great  all right  so can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"umm that is a good question  umm I think  so freshman year ummm I participated in a program here called terescope (sp?). And it\\u2019s a program that basically gives freshman a problem to solve. Ummm kind of like a world problem. And so you are just kind of left on your own to solve it. Umm and our problem was solving world hunger. So it is really like a problem that no one has actually solved. \", \"That's great.\": \"Um  I'm working on being more outgoing  so  like I said  I've stepped up  both on the crew team and as part of my living group...\", \"Tell me about a time you were working a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?\": \"of the main problems we had was maybe not necessarily like figuring out the problem  but like figuring out who - how to best organize ourselves  and how to best kind of - ummm when people should step up and be leaders ummm so what I guess learned from that a lot was trying to not necessary like pinpoint one leader  but more like collaborative working together because what like seemed happened when one person stepped up  they necc - they necessary wouldn't be doing a lot  just kind of be like trying to tell people what to do. \", \"Great  okay. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?\": \"n\\u2019t effective at all. Instead of just like trying to brainstorm  together problem solve together. Like maybe have someone be one person be more like a facilitator and kind of leading the discussion. Instead of telling people what to do. Being like oh this is what you said  and do you want to follow up on that.\\u201d  Or like how can we best really tackle that issue. I think what I learned form that what I learned from that  in order to be a leader within a group you need to be asking questions  instead of telling people what to do. Giving people more responsibility and and almost have someone be more like. And giving people more responsibility. Umm and like make them feel like they are taking ownership versus your putting ownership on them. I think that is what the purpose of the class actually is  to teach you how to work in groups  throughout MIT you work in groups pete (sp?) says  so I think I actually learned a lot from that class  just kind of observing how everything was going on.\", \"Great  last question - Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Ummm  hmmm  so let's think  so that is a good question. I think sometimes I have trouble working on a project when like  for example when I have too much time right. So umm for example this summer I was working in DC ummm and I felt like when I wasn't given an exact dead line I didn't necessarily like push myself to work to get it done  because it wasn't -- I didn't  have a dead line like I wasn\\u2019t sure when I needed it to get done so I was like oh  that\\u2019 fine  okay I can do it later. So I think one of my weaknesses I think it is pushing things off unless there is a deadline. So I really have been trying setting internal deadlines for myself. And trying to stick to those deadlines  and I think it is really hard  I think it is really hard when you have a lot of things to do to figure out how to prioritize and actually come through with the deadlines. And I think that is really important skill throughout life. So for example this week I have a lot of things due at the end of the week. So trying to get at least a certain amount done by Tuesday  and kind of like evaluating my progress throughout the week is something I have been trying to work on more. \", \"Great  thank you.\": \"Well  we will pretend this is the (inaudible) institute. I am really interested in studying the intersection on nutrition and health  ummm especially in the kind of evaluating project area. So recently I actually switched to economics  umm I was originally studying biology  but I felt that I could - that there is more to be done in economics in terms of helping people and I really would be excited to learn more about how food security and nutrition intersect. And I would be very committed and willing to work as much as you needed me to. \", \"Good! Alright  so  tell me about yourself.\": \"Um  my name is Stephie. Um  I am a junior here at MIT. Um  and  see  I'm currently studying Computer Science  so  um. I'm a six three  um  and  I'm here hoping to  you know  get in touch  and um  see if there's any opportunity for me over at Google.\", \"Great! [inaudible] So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um  see... Hm  so last semester  um  I took a class in software constructions.\", \"Great. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"[laugh] How about that? Um  let's talk about that second group project in this class.\", \"Mm-hm\": \"I think I have great leadership potential. Uh  I am currently head of the Greek MedLinks at MIT. And what MedLinks is  is this really great program where we serve as the liaison between students and healthcare facilities. MIT has so much support  so much support. And there is...I mean we have...the students have great access to it. But a lot of times we don't know to look for it. Right? It can be right in front of your face  and if you're not looking  it's not there. So we do a lot of outreach stuff. \", \"Great. I'm glad that worked out for you.\": \"Thanks.\", \"So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Um  see... I- let's see  I- for the longest time  even when I was small  I've always been pretty quiet. \", \"Okay  good. What have you been doing specifically? \": \"Um  see  uh. Well  I've- I've taken classes with  um  with like  speaking components and presentations. Um  so it's  it's a way to get in- my feet into the water. But  um  it's been a good experience  so.\", \"Great. Okay  last question. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Hmm  I think that I have a lot to offer. Um  my skill set is  pretty good? Um  you know I've- I've picked up a lot of skills here at MIT and also on my own  um  through research here at MIT.\", \"Good. So  tell me about yourself.\": \"I guess I feel like I need to be very involved in things I do whether they be like if I'm doing a project or leading an activity I feel like I need to be very on top of whats going on - which is of course a good thing you obviously if your in charge of something you want to be aware of whats happening. But I think its my weakness because it allows me to not allocate enough to other people and it cop me to stress myself out and possibly not have as good as a final project because I've taken too much on for myself. So that's obviously a kind of weakness and uhm what I've kinda been currently doing to counter it.. is uhm  really working on finding like friends to kinda like overview what I'm doing especially if I'm involved in. Very specifically delligating stuff to them and working on kinda like not doing as much and trusting others to do stuff and get the job done and let someone work without checking in to really promote like letting them to go do their own thing and not concern myself with it obviously responsibly but also at the same time to not over burden myself.\", \"Mmhmm\": \" Good  how are you?\", \"Career goals?\": \"Um  I'd like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again.\", \"Great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"I'm doing pretty well.\", \"Can you be a little bit more specific?\": \"Um  So as house manager  um  I organized work week at the beginning of this year. So it's a time when - there's about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and  um  works on the house  paints rooms  like fixes it up before the school year starts. So I organized that  assigned jobs to people and facilitated that.\", \"Okay  great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Um  so I'm also on the rowing team.\", \"So the way you change the attitude was by?\": \"Um  kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down  but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had.\", \"Okay. Great. And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Um  one of my weaknesses  I tend to be  I guess  a little more withdrawn sometimes. Um  and that's something I've been working on like I've taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team  um  but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener. \", \"Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"I'm good. How are you?\", \"Good. So tell me about yourself.\": \"So yeah  so I've been taking a lot of computer science and technology classes. Um in my free time I like to  um  write for the Tech and a be edit  um articles at the  um the student newspaper  for the student newspaper. Um I also like to bake and like um like exercising and running  stuff like that.\", \"Oh wow\": \"...in the first place. They just knew  okay  we want this model to do this and do that  and do that. We're not too sure how it's going to do it  but  you know  just come up with some things. \", \"Great what are your career goals.\": \"Ok. Soo this I guess this happens quite a bit during a my stint as um campus life editor of the Tech. So a what happens is  um  like um  for my section I have to a make sure that the publication is like going out on time.\", \"Great. Ok. So tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership.\": \"So  um  one time I demonstrated leadership was in getting a um  column for for the campus life section. So there was a um  the precedent of the Pan-Hellenic society um want to have like a column in the Tech for Greek life. And so um  I negotiated with her to like um  sort to arrange how the column would work  because like um  I guess we both had the same like um  intent of how we should like publish articles  but her ideas were slightly different from mine in that she  if your original idea was that she wanted to  I could  it was kind of like advertisement in the Tech and um  people like  like the Tech is a newspaper you don\\u2019t like necessarily want articles to be like advertising sororities so we made a deal with her to like um  write articles that would be more about the personal side and not like um to avertisey.\", \"mhm\": \"Hmm  Ah...Um I guess again probably using um  let me see..ok so I guess again on  for the Tech cause it's like my major leadership my pretty main extracurricular. Um  I guess um  what happened was um  shit  um I really don\\u2019t know how to answer these type of questions sorry.\", \"Ok great. So  tell me about a time you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Um...\", \"It's ok  take your time.\": \"Um...Ok I guess I'll go back to high school then. So in high school I was on the cross country team and um  so what happened was we a like we're  we're competing right so we um  so we had to like  um train in groups so on so on team sports and what happened was kind of that the  um so there's a girls team and a boys team and like um the boys team a was  i guess people the boys were like motivated and things like that and like they would um  and the girls team was like less motivated and wha  and so since they were less motivated they would do stuff like if the coach asked you to like run around this block than they would like sort of cut  take short cuts and stuff like that. Um  I guess what happened was my um  there was another student on the team who was also  who was also like really motivated and I wanted to improve running so I think initially I guess we sort of tried asking people like Hey um  could you not do that?  but eventually what happened was I guess we  me and the other more motivated girl trained with the boys team because that was really the only way  like I mean there's  there's motivating people  but in the sense like they have to want to do it themselves so I guess that's what happened.\", \"It doesn't necessarily be extracurricular either.\": \"OK  Um  I would  let me think. One of my  I guess one weakness I have is um  well MIT is full of smart people right. Um  if everybody is like always doing like these amazing products and projects and I mean like coding since they were like nine years old and stuff  so because of the like abundance of geniuses I sometimes I feel like I'm not as at their level. So um  I guess what I try  what I try to do is like I  I was  feeling badly  but then I realized. Well first of all I guess everybody has to start somewhere. I've been like training my own skills like  reach up to the  to learn more in depth and eventually I'll get that good  just takes like practice and I've also been like just sort of telling myself that it's  to like just apply to things and like don\\u2019t  and I guess sort of fake it till you make it right. So make like um  project the image of like confidence and then it will probably come.\", \"Ok.  Great. So can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Well um  so I've been learning a lot about um  computer science since I was here. I've um  I am a pretty reliable person so like for example during the Tech I always like am reliably like editing everything  getting thing in time  on deadline. Though if you gave me an assignment then I would reliably like a work on it and um and I  and not procrastinate or anything like that. Um I'm pretty good at learning as demonstrated by my ability to succeed at MIT and um I also um  I would a really enjoy working and contributing to the Google community as a person and a I hope that a  I would be able to produce um  good products.\", \"Great\": \"I\\u2019m a student of computer science at MIT. I\\u2019m in my Junior year. I\\u2019ve been studying the whole time.I\\u2019ve been teaching last summer in the field. It was a start up in Venice Beach  California and I enjoyed it quite a bit.\", \"Ready? So how are you doing today?\": \"Uh  so  right now I'm actually quite involved with the Global Poverty Initiative here at MIT  and I'm currently the director of ACTION under GPI  Global Poverty Initiative  so I'm currently in charge of the projects we are involved with abroad  so that includes projects in Mexico  service projects in Central Mexico...\", \"Good. So  tell me about yourself. \": \"...as well as a project with a domestic..an NGO in India that works with domestic workers in setting up domestic workers with local employers  and training women  and working with employer-employee relationships. Um  most of my work has been on the Mexico project  and I led a team -- I actually have traveled down three times -- and we have a greenhouse initiative that is our main goal right now  and I oversaw a team of four people on two separate trips where we built fourteen greenhouses as well as conducted classes at the secondary school as well as classes for adults in both computers and English.\", \"Great. [pause] So  can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership? \": \"orked with NGOs on the ground  um  and they've actually managed to continue our projects since we've been gone  uh  as well as working with the Peace Corps  and  uh  they've actually recently decided to send a full-time Peace Corps volunteer to the rural community where we were working  so...\", \"Um-hmm.\": \"...that was really validating.\", \"Good. OK. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? \": \"Um  so  probably the largest challenge that we had when we got there was working across cultures and identifying with community members  because when we went there  we had originally thought -- we had brainstormed project ideas like solar ovens and greenhouses and bio-digesters  which are used to make fertilizer from natural waste -- and when we got there  we talked to lots of community members. First of all  they can be rather skeptical of outsides coming in  so we first had to earn their trust  and we had to establish that we weren't going to  um  just come in and give them something and leave. This wasn't going to be a hand-out. \", \"OK.\": \"Um  I do  um. Well  there is all that said  sorts definitions of leadership. I do believe  um  that I have had the good fortune of being a leader  um  in numerous student clubs  and in high school  and even at MIT. Um  even in the presence of graduate students. Um  I\\u2019ve managed to sort of  um. Obivously  they know more academically  but  um  I\\u2019ve still managed to like hold my ground. Oh  and because I think I\\u2019m involved in a lot of stuff that goes on on campus  stuff  that\\u2019s just  and um  that\\u2019s what sort of made me realize that  um  I do like people. I like working with people  and I like generally working on a team. I do believe I\\u2019m good enough to sort of lead and at the same time technical enough to sort of understand what it is that we want to achieve. And convince everyone  and have this mutual consensus that this is how we should do it.\", \"Great. OK. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? \": \"s a challenge  but in the end  we ended up using community feedback to determine which project we wanted to do. So  they were most interested in greenhouses as well as some [?] small business  so we ended up catering to both of those project ideas. The way that we decided to work around the not wanting to seem like we were giving a hand-out  we actually had all the families build their own greenhouses with our help. \", \"Great. OK. Last question: Why do you think we should hire you? \": \"buted all the materials and then had them pay small deposits so they would have some small investment into the project. Obviously they couldn't afford to pay for the whole thing. Um  then we worked with each individual family  and they built it and made it their own  and so they had a bigger incentive to take care of it. \", \"Okay  great. So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"I think I have a diverse skill set  and I have very diverse background working with other cultures  not only in Mexico  but I've had experiences in Europe and in China. I'm bi-racial myself  and I think I have a very unique background  and especially as an engineer who's interested in going into consulting  and I have work experience at Space-X and NASA and  um  other companies. \", \"Wow  okay.\": \"fer very unique perspective into what your company culture would be. And I think that's very important  in not having everyone have the same background and everyone in your community...you need different perspectives  and I think I would definitely help fill that. \", \"Right  right right right right right.\": \"I'm doing very well. How are you?\", \"Mhmm.\": \"Um  I think of myself sometimes as a leader. Um  definitely able to organize things and get things done when they need to be done. Um  ahem  I'm not the most organized person. Uh  so in some regard  I have doubt. But  uh  I think I've been pretty successful in getting groups to acheive goals and that kind of thing.\", \"Great  okay. And can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge? What did you do to solve that problem?\": \"And it was the first time I'd ever been  which was very exciting um. And it was a very cool experience 'cause not only were they teaching a lot of leadership skills  but also a lot of you know the daily activities we did like going for really long hikes and things just kind of brought out that innate like  'someone has to make sure everyone brought enough water.'\", \"Oh  okay.\": \"It was a [xx?] of [xx?] and one of our group-mates did the whole thing.\", \"Mhmm. \": \"-ology in order to learn more about like the pharmaceutical aspect of the rain.  Um  and so that\\u2019s- I\\u2019m trying to get myself towards patent law.  In pharmaceuticals I guess.\", \"Right  right right.\": \"And just kind of that group mentality of making sure everyone was getting their experiments done. Um and then it was also interesting 'cause there were a lot of language barriers that were going on in lab.\", \"Okay. Right. So  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Um 'cause there were some Israelis that were working there.\", \"Mhmm  mhmm.\": \"And checking emails and making sure they made sense  and things like that.\", \"Okay  great. And  last question: Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Sure. Uh  I think sometimes I tend to be a little bit on the shy side. Especially um like if I'm the person coming into a new group or a new experience. And I think I just kind of have to remind myself like  there's a reason why I'm here.\", \"Great  okay.\": \"Um  I think for me where I'm  where I am at this point  where I'm deciding between sort of going the medical school route or the research route;\", \"I'm doing well. So  tell me about yourself.\": \"Um  and I think just sort of that open-mindedness towards both sides will help out the hospital a lot. Because you know it's always good to have people that are interacting between the pure doctors and the pure scientist level.\", \"Mm hmm.\": \"Um. I'm a core 16 here at MIT  which is aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Um. I'm a junior. Um. And my experience has been last summer I worked with NASA Glenn Research Center doing  ah  interplanetary rover work. Um. I was. \", \"Great. Alright. So can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Um. I'm good. How are you?\", \"Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"ign work with Jeff Landis as my mentor. Um. So  ah  yeah I had a really good time working on that project. Um. Doing a lot of (inaudible) coding. Making a lot of design decisions. Um. As well as ah separately working on a project with just my fellow interns where we  um  where we built a autonomous navigation system for a Dropsonde. Um which is a meteorological measuring device. Um but we didn't worry about the Dropsonde itself  we were just concerned with building a navigation system.\", \"Good. And which ended up working better?\": \"Um. So  that it could be recovered by  um  the people who are using it. Um  and I personally worked on the steerable para-foil parachute for that.\", \"OK. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Um. Yes. I can. Um. When we were working on the Dropsonde project which I mentioned before  um  there was um  some question about whether we were gonna be able to get a good drop site for it. Um  because in order to test how the navigation system worked we had to have the thing flying for a significant period of time. Um. So  it was fairly...it takes um  not very long for most things to fall from reasonable height. So we had to find a really good drop location.\", \"And why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Okay  so  I'm also involved in MIT Undergraduate research journal  and uh last spring we we we we publish twice a year  at the end of each semester  and last spring um we were a little late in our uh  in our uh  timeline  so  it was kind of near finals week  and we still hadn't gotten anything published. So  uh  sorry this was last fall  so we still had the spring semester to uh sort of remediate our uh error. So um  we kind of  um  all  you know  pitched in together  and I guess the main thing we had to uh draw upon was each other's initiative  like in the whole process  and motivation  and motivation  you know  for some people  it's more self-centered  and for others  it's more of a community motivation  you know? And we each had to tap into our individual editors' motivation you know  what kind of people they were  what they were looking for  et cetera  so we had to get people kind of  uh  self started in a way. And uh  yeah  we we got to work really quickly and uh and and we had it published by like the first two weeks of the spring semester so uh. yeah. yeah. It was a good skill that I picked up  kind of  how to tap into people's sense of initiative and stuff. So. \", \"How are you doing?\": \"Well I guess I should probably pick a different time that I was working on a team. Um. So  um  when..for the Venus rover  which was the other project that I worked on last summer. Um  we had  um  we basically started just with with nothing. Um  because  um  this  this idea's really like in early design phases. It's not like..there's no Venus rover being built by any team. It's just people like sitting down working equations figuring out what would be feasible for a Venus rover. \", \"Good. Can you tell me about yourself?\": \"'s a flexibility there. Lot of room to sort of um figure out what we thought would work out best. And initially there is  um  there are two basically competing ideas. Um  there was the idea of using  ahh  wind turbine  um  to power the rover. Verses having actually be a land sailer. Um. And  I mean there was no clear answer regarding which one of those was better. \", \"MmmHmm.\": \"bine had some advantage in that it would be able to sit and charge  what would the term...the....it would be able to sit still and um  accumulate power as the wind blew on it so it wouldn't have to be moving constantly. Um  where is the land sailer would have to have some threshold level of wind to move to work (inaudible) friction. \", \"Great. Okay  so tell me about a time you've demonstrated leadership. \": \"ve that then it wouldn't be able to do anything useful. Um  so in that way the turbine seemed a little bit less risky  but a turbine also has more moving parts. Um  and it would require a little bit more on the electronics side and that's riskier as well. Um  so it was...um  so yeah  it was not a clear decision. \", \"Okay. Tell me about a time where you were on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"rough each others processes. Um made sure that we were sort of working from the same assumptions. Um  which we were  I mean cause I mean we both like did an honest job with it. Um  and then we just went based on the math. Which one seemed like it was gonna work out better. Um  so it ended up being non confrontational.\", \"Mmmhmm.\": \"I study ocean engineering at MIT.  I\\u2019m a junior and I\\u2019m really interested in building robots to use in the ocean.  Like  this summer I worked on an underwater vehicle to look at sea ice in Antarctica.  \", \"Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?  \": \"Um. Yeah. I am not extremely well organized. Um  so  ahh  yeah. My ...my work tends to be a little bit of a mess and I have trouble meeting deadlines. Um. But I ...um  overcome it just by recognizing something that....recognizing that something that will happen to be where my work will become sloppy and I will miss deadlines if I don't really pay attention to it. Um  so  I do writing down deadlines keeping a Google calendar. Um. Trying to keep myself on top of things.\", \"Great. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Um. I think you should hire me because  um  I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and I think...I think my grades at MIT really prove that I am intelligent and hard working. Um  and  I think that  as well as that I also have the experience that you would want at JPO. Working on interplanetary rovers  I've done that before. Also worked on teams um  to try to accomplish goals. Um  so I think that really I am a pretty well qualified applicant for this position.\", \"Good.\": \"I\\u2019d be smarter  yeah obviously but  I think I would like to have a better capability to understand those sides of things. Sorry that sounds really weird. In general I do but for computer science or science specifically there\\u2019s the part that I am really good at which is everything that has to do with languages and puzzle solving that\\u2019s great. That\\u2019s fun. I like it a lot. But then there is also the side that is a little bit more mathematical and that is something that I struggle with. They are definitely different things people are typically good at either one or the other but being good at both is a little less common and that would be really awesome.\", \"Um how are you doing today?\": \"Um  I'm currently a junior studying chemistry in biology  at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. I'm primarily interested in biochemistry research  pacifically  how small molecules interact with the body  um  and produce physiological effects. \", \"tell me about yourself.\": \"I've done research as an undergraduate  um  in the lab that's chemistry and biological  um  engineering. So I've been able to work at a chemical  biology interface.\", \"Great. Tell me how you've demonstrated leadership.\": \"I've demonstrated leadership through my role in dorm's house government.\", \"Tell me about a time when working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"I've been dieting chair and environmental chair for almost two years. Um  so through that I've been able to work with others  and um  work with the  like  other members of house government as well as the administration. Um  and bring  um  concerns from residents to the administration  and represent them.    \", \"Great. And tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it.\": \"Um  as opposed to just being frustrated with the fact where we are currently  try to see how to go forward with that. \", \"Great. And why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Um and that was a great experience. So coming back um I was uh elected as \", \"So  uhh  how are you doing?\": \"I would say my weakness is actually leadership experience  because I haven't had a lot of it. Um  I also haven't had much experience working in a team environment  but I have been seeking out opportunities to improve this  um  looking for even more of a role in house government this year  um  and actually running for house president. How soon to try to get a leadership position. So I'm trying to more experience in those areas.\", \"I\\u2019m well. Thanks for coming.\": \"I think you should hire me because I bring experience from  um  from my education at M.I.T.  which has really prepared me for a rigorous work environment  to work hard and be able to solve problems  and I've demonstrated this to my work at other internships and my research that I've already done. \", \"It\\u2019s ok. So please tell me about yourself.\": \"Good thanks.\", \"Mmm-hmm.\": \"I- I- I\\u2019d actually say  umm  I- I wish I was a lot better in working- in working in teams. \", \"OK  cool. Uhh  so  uhh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um and we actually get along pretty well so there's not too many conflicts. But I think this is silly as it sounds. One of the things is what we eat after meals or after games. Um and so I think it's kind of nice sometimes I'll just speak with one or two players r come to a consensus before we really discuss with the team what we are doing after games. And so that way I kind of get a feel like amongst the 3 or 4 of us like what the team would like be most receptive to something like that and so then we come to some kind of consensus this is what we're gonna do instead of opening it up to the entire team. Like what would you like to do after the game? And getting you know 16 different opinions and having to deal with that. I'm getting like of small set of like you know options and we have people with dietary restrictions and things like that. So uh I think that way it's just being able to get a couple of different opinions  come to a conclusion before um making a decision. That's been pretty successful.\", \"[laughs]\": \"...But then  when it came down to deciding on one or figuring out how you wanted to move forward  who would take on which responsibilities  it was  um  quite tense (laughs) for our team  I would say... Um  so  as the oldest two on the team  myself and one other teammate  we... I feel like we really stepped it up in terms of being  um  very methodical and very  like...\", \"So tell me about a time you were on a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you overcome it?\": \"Umm  otherwise I just . . . I really just enjoy working on random projects. Going to Aca-thons [SP?] a lot and hanging out with people. Umm  yeah. Just building cool things. Uhh  otherwise  uhh  my main thing I do afterwards is ultimate Frisbee  which I really enjoy.\", \"Hmm.\": \"\\u2026 which is where you lead about \\u201ccoughs\\u201d six to eight people  umm  and you all have to work as a unit to earn  ahh  honor squad at the end of semester. \", \"Huh.\": \"Umm  so  uhh  getting all this organized like everyday was umm  definitely like pretty hard to do. And I had to get people passionate enough to be wanting to play every time that we needed to play. Umm  and by the end  uhh  we went to a tournament in Texas . . .\", \"Ahh.\": \"Ok  umm let\\u2019s see\\u2026 So I as I said I\\u2019m from Taiwan and I\\u2019m  I\\u2019m part of a student group here at MIT  called the association of Taiwanese students  and what I actually was  was a cultural chair uh  for a year  and one of our main events is to create a night market  so umm  yeah  so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia  uhh we actually took it inside into our student center  so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs  so this included like the Chinese students club  umm  the association of  sorry the Asian American Association  as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event  and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food  and what we thought  we thought that this was you know  one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place  so umm  yeah I think that you know ha\\u2026 getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm  you know time everybody needed to set up  umm and we  yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that  and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something  umm  you know  arise out of that.\", \"Ohh.\": \"Umm  just a lot of playing around with my friends yeah.\", \"Ahh. \": \"Uhh  hmm  OK. So let\\u2019s- let\\u2019s go with robotics. That was one of the classes I was in  uhh  last semester. So  umm  basically  uhh  the first half of the class was just learning in general about robots.\", \"So tell me about one of your weaknesses and how do you plan to overcome it?\": \"And figuring out  umm  you know  just like all the electronics first of all and then actually the computer sense behind it  doing vision and such. Umm  so finally at the very end of the  umm  uhh  class we had to make our own robots.\", \"You can pick anything.\": \"And so what I did there  umm  basically  uhh we had a few meetings to figure out what type of robot we would be building and stuff. Umm  and I guess  uhh  what I wanted to do was  umm  basically go ahead with everything we\\u2019d already done. Uhh  and just push forward with that and just finish off basically. And what my team members wanted to do was actually redo everything and start from the very bottom.\", \"Hmm. Mmm-hmm.\": \". . . and what we had with this  we had a tile floor that we kind of cheated with. We had a tile floor and then walls . . .\", \"Uhh.\": \"I think the first time they\\u2019d actually had  umm  some- something like this instead of just looking for balls and doing path planning. Umm  actually local- relocalization in the world.\", \"Mmm-hmm. Now why do you think we should hire you?\": \"OK  uhh  hmm. One of my weaknesses? Umm  I would go with  umm  . . . umm . . .Yeah I should\\u2019ve had a better answer for this question . . .umm  I guess . . . I don\\u2019t know if I can plan to overcome it. [laughing] I don\\u2019t know.\", \"Mmm-hmm. Well thank you. \\u2018Preciate your interviewing with us today.\": \"Umm  uhh  I mean just like  just- just various aspects of just everything. You know  like working in this social club where we just throw offense in general for students and you know  I\\u2019ve got like various ideas that I need to get across to people but sometimes people don\\u2019t agree with me and . . .\", \"Good!\": \"Yeah. \", \"Good. Um  tell me about yourself?\": \". . . and just doing more  uhh  basically again  like I\\u2019ve been doing a lot of teamwork in general. \", \"Oh  great!\": \"\", \"Tell me about how a time you've demonstrated leadership?\": \"Umm  [laughs] uhh  I guess because  umm  I- I would probably say the one word comes down to passion.\", \"Great. Okay. So tell about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge? How did you solve that problem?\": \". . . and like explaining stuff and like listening to people. Umm  so I think I- I- I bring kind of some liveliness to places and also with this passion goes- I\\u2019m always looking at new stuff  learning new stuff and- and teaching people about it  umm  and you know just enjoy making stuff.\", \"Oh  wow!\": \"How are you?\", \"Okay  so...\": \"Um  I'm Nikki. I'm a course 6 major at MIT this year. I live at east campus. Um  what do you want to know?\", \"Um  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to do to overcome it?\": \"Friendship  leadership and service. It was on my [xx?] organizing the events that...helped to foster friendship among the brothers.\", \"Okay  and last question. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Yeah.\", \"Good. Ready?\": \"I haven't had this kind of interview in forever....I'm going to ask you to code.\", \"So  tell me about yourself.\": \"I'm really quiet.\", \"Oh just like a general idea of what your interests are and like you know what kind of goals you're looking for in terms of the future.\": \"I just speak really quietly and it's because in my head it sounds louder than I guess it is.\", \"Great! So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"I work on it. I try to project and all that. I ask people to tell me if I'm being too quiet  cause I can't [xx?]. It's a real problem though.\", \"Okay. So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"For what? Uhm  because I learn really quickly.\", \"I mean any situation where you're working with people and there is an issue.\": \"Um. I bring a very positive attitude to the job and I like to have fun with what I do.\", \"Okay  great. Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"And I work hard at it and I don't what to let people down [xx?].\", \"Great! Last question - why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Good.\", \"Ready.  So how are you doing today?\": \"Uh  well I'm a Junior. I'm an MIT student. Um  I'm majoring in both Math and Computer Science. Uh what sort of skills and interests are you looking to find out about?\", \" Good.  Tell me about yourself.\": \"Cool  well I'm really interested in distributed systems actually and that's more of a research interest and the sort of application that it generally tends to have when I look at companies is parallel computing. Um  I actually did an internship last summer with Amazon and uh for them I ended up doing a lot of parallel computing with the hoodoo platform. I'm also taking 6172 which is a performance engineering class and we do a lot of parallelism in C++.\", \" great.  and can you tell me a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Well  uh  this was in high school but in high school I was the  uh  president of our robotics team as well as the  uh  in the earlier years the head of  respectively the  the  uh mechanical engineering team and our mechanical arm team. Uh  and you know that was a good leadership experience uh  I've also been in  uh  in 6172 we have group projects - they're only two people - but um  in some of the projects I've been the person doing a lot of the organizing. Uh  yeah  um.\", \" mmhmm\": \" Okay.  That's an interesting question.  Um  I think  I think so a lot of the candidates you've seen probably  um  come in with similar abilities.  You know  students at schools like MIT tend to be very top  at the top of their class.  Um  so  I wouldn't say there's much that differentiates me there.  But I would say that I think I would get along well with your company. Um  I  people who have worked with me before have told me that I'm just sort of a fun person to be on a team with. Um  so  if you sort of look out to other aspects beyond just the numbers or GPA  or what's on my resume  you know  try to maybe you know  if you want me to hang around at  have  hang out at the office for a couple of days and  you know  work with you guys  we can see how that goes I'm confident that uh  you'd think I  you would conclude that I would be a good fit here. \", \" uh huh\": \" yeah.  Um so im uh vice president of corporalations (sp) for the society of woman engineers.  And um we just held in September a career fair banquet.  So we had a dinner for about 200 people following the career fair.  Um and its it\\u2019s a huge event to organize in the sense that students need to be matched up with companies that suit their interest for dinner.  \", \" Mmm.\": \"I think you should hire me because I'm technically qualified  I get along well with people  I am interested in these fields. Like  I'm excited about Computer Science it's like what I want to do. It's a large part of who I am - the Math and Computer Science part of me. And as a result  I'm going to enjoy work  and enjoy working with people. Um  also the people I spend my time with outside of work will tend to be very similar kinds of people to the kinds of people I'll be interacting with at work. And so  it tends to work out pretty well. In my previous internship with Amazon my team liked me a lot because I'm pretty laid back and enjoy joking around with people. Bake food  you know. So I  yeah  you know I will solve your technical problems and I will get along with the team.\", \" right\": \" so the goal is just to have kind of a relaxed networking event after you know the hecticness of the carrerr fair.\", \" great.  Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?\": \" Good  how are you?\", \" Mmm\": \" team was it became very disorganized because we didn\\u2019t know what the other tasks were what the other people were doing.\", \" Great.  Tell me about one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it?\": \" and in the end we ended up having to work throughout the event to keep things running smoothly and I wanted the team members to be able to sit down and have dinner as well.\", \" Uh huh\": \" I think  um kind of within my personality\", \" Mmhmm \": \"um  so one of our senior design or not our senior but one of our design classes within chemical engineering\", \" Uh huh \": \"um so kind of to addrses that problem I sat down with him  had a conversation with him about it  you know we are all feeling kind of the strain of this project  the deadline is coming.  Um but um you know we cant have anyone sitting on the sidelines so what is it that you want to get more involved in or where do you think your skills are?  And it turned out that um he wasn\\u2019t very um he wasn\\u2019t very comfortable writing the code in the program.  \", \" -great.  And last question.  Why do you think we should hire you?\": \" So he didn\\u2019t want to write bunky code and just have somebody else try to fix his work all the time but he was very tight with the teaching assistants and so he could funnel our questions through them and getr us some good answers um back from them so that we could keep going through the project so through that conversation we found a way for him to contribute\", \" great\": \" I hacve a lot of a lot of go go go and uh and  a lot of times I don\\u2019t um  realize that waiting is the best option you know just letting certain events take their course um may in fact be the best option.  Um so kind of to give you a good example of this is um when I was trying to decide which internships um or which internship offerse to accept I kind of was very anxious to kind of pick one and go with it um and kinf of get started in meeting people \", \"So  how are you doing today? \": \"So I uh  you know  coordinated this group of motley girls along with my coach and we had a lot of competitions where candy was the reward.\", \"Oh yeah  the weather's great. Um. Talk about yourself.\": \" And to just communicate with other people saying that you know I really do think that pushing the deadline is the best\", \"Oh.\": \"Umm we being?\", \"Mmhmm. \": \" -I think that I have a uh ability to contribute really well to the group so not just bringing the knowledge um or the skills that are\", \"Mmhmm.\": \"More about my backround  well... I'm from Canada  but I grew up in South Florida because  you know  one day my parents just decided that it was too cold *interviewer laughs* so they literally just decided to pick up and move. Uhh  so I basically lived there my whole life until I decided to come here for school  and  you know  since then I've just been going through MIT... I'm trying to do a lot of pre-med things. I like to volunteer. Uhhh  you know  strong family values  things like that. So...\", \"Great! So tell me about how you have demonstrated leadership. \": \" Uh huh\", \"Good job.\": \" Discussion and um really emerge myself in whats going on would make me a stellar candidate I think\", \"So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? \": \"I'm  uh  pretty good. The weather's nice  uh  outside. \", \"Definitely.  \": \"Okay  so I'm a Junior.\", \"Great! Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to work on it? \": \"I'm a Junior at IT. Going to graduate  uh  a semester early  actually. \", \"Okay. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you? \": \"So I'm going to be graduating next fall.\", \"so how are you?\": \"Um. Because uh...I  I've been doing my  my work pretty quickly I guess so I\", \"Good. Tell me about yourself?\": \"So uh I can graduate early  that's a good thing. Um I'm interested in going into nutrition in the long run. Uh  whether it be through medical school or  you know  even  a certification.\", \"Alright. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Whatever  but I uh in the meantime  I want to get into Life Sciences consulting. And I want to um explore the field and and and uh yeah...do it as as soon as I can  pretty  much  as long as I can. In the field. Um being successful. Uh  and getting somewhere. Uh. So. Uh  yeah. \", \"Great. And can you tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Okay  so I am President of the Endometrius Society  and last year we organized a networking event so uh that  that comprised of not only students but also  like  working professionals in the Boston area  so basically I got in touch with and invited every single Armenian that I knew  in the Boston area  and it ended up being a hundred plus event that we actually coordinated in one of the dorms here in Bexley hall  so it was also a lot of logistical um  you know  like  practice  getting over uh  getting around the rules and stuff with capacity and everything and whether or not to serve alcohol and all that stuff. So uh that that was a very big event and uh it was very successfully because people were still talking about it today. So.\", \"Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Thank you.\", \"Yeah  so how are you doing today?\": \"Yeah. So  uh  one of my weakness I think is  uh  like well  shyness. You know  um um and I may see a little like confident  you know  on the outside  but um I definitely have my moments where I'm like you know  I just  freeze  and I feel like so  you know  like I can't talk to anyone  pretty much  you know  and it's like  it's like maybe ten percent of the time that I'm like that  but uh I kinda want to like get rid of that completely  so  yeah I'm just I'm doing  I'm like putting myself into more like  challenging situations  socially and stuff  to kind of like overcome it. So um  yeah  just  like  you know  taking advantage of every opportunity that comes my way  to be social  and stuff  like going to parties  and just being used to being around people  because definitely at MIT you can become  like  socially uh  you know  like  blocked away  so. Yeah. \", \"Good. Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?\": \"Um  so I draw upon a lot of leadership experiences  with my enrollment at MIT student groups  um  I've completed three years of MIT without going insane  that's just a joke  but um  um...and I'm very  you know  like  um I'm very organized  I'm a self-starter  I'm  you know  I take initiative  I've organized a lot of events through these student groups  so I'm I'm um  I'm definitely able to take upon like large tasks with being organized  and you know very  like  having initiative. So yeah.\", \"Ok  so  tell me about a time you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \" I think a very recent example is I am going to be chair of my sorority so we just held an event called catwalk  which is ten months of planning  but it took a lot of delegation  a lot of staying on top of things because there's so many components they needed to coordinate. We ended up having fourteen designers but we had to contact way more than that from around the Boston area. And the sorority has a hundred forty girls in it  so all of them has to participate in some way  whether it's working with a designer or helping me to create the decoration scheme or logistics. I personally think it ran really smoothly as a result of extreme organization. I had a co-chair and another girl helping me organize it and we got very good at creating tabs on Google Docs to stay on top of things \", \"Ok  so that's [pause] Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?\": \"\", \"And  what are you doing to overcome it?\": \"I think one of my weaknesses is my--I forget what it is called. Oh  lack of assertiveness  or lack of confidence in a way. Like I always want to make sure that everyone's ideas are heard  and I feel like lots of times I don't want to create conflict  so I'll kind of back down after a little bit. I'm very open to sharing my ideas  but if there's a lot of criticism then I will back down  and that's something that I'm working on a lot  like just trying to stand behind my own ideas  trying to be more objective about them so I have reasons to resent so that I don't feel like there's any reason for me to need to back down.\", \"Excellent. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"I think you should hire me because I am very passionate about product design. I feel like it's something that people told me when I started the mechanical engineering lessons  they were like Oh  you just lit up and I can see that you found your passion here. I feel like I'm very detail oriented  so I'm able to create CAD models in a very methodical manner  instead of just drawing random things together. I'm able to think of design for manufacturing overall  and not just what looks nice on paper  but what's actually practicable. I think I am a great team player in that even though I can be passive sometimes  in a way it's good to have people with different levels of aggressiveness  and different levels of confidence  because that way it's not all like  butting heads all the time.  And I think that as I improve in my own smoothly and not confrontationally with people  but also get things done very effectively.   \", \"How are you doing today? \": \"Um  yes I do think I'm a leader.\", \"Me too. tell me about yourself. \": \"Ok  well i'm a junior at MIT and I'm currently studying Computer Science and Biology. It's a new joint major with a minor in management. So that's a little bit of my background. Um  last summer I worked at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco.  I was in their principal investing group. So  I was investing in a lot of longer term securities. So  it was like buy side trading.\", \"Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership\": \"Ok  so  my freshman year  um  I was doing this project called Six Four Seventy and this is during IEP. It's like a competition where you're supposed to get a team and design your on website. So  it was like the first time that all of us had been doing this kind of programming before. Well  I had a little background but not much. Um  and  basically at the end of the day it came to me to get the team together because everyone was doing other things. And it's IEP  everyone is trying to have fun also. Then I was like guys we have deadlines. We need to get a B in this. So  basically I stepped into a leadership roll and I brought our team together and we managed to finish our project and pass the class.\", \"Great  can you give me an idea of like  how you...\": \"It didn't win any of us awards but at least we finished it.\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem. \": \"I guess that is kind of related to my previous example. I can talk more in depth about it  I guess.\", \"Great  and you guys found the problem?\": \"Um  so  I guess our main issue was getting the back end database to work correctly. Um  which none of us had ever programmed with  like  MySQL or any of those languages before  you know. So  um  I basically tried to delegate tasks. So  I made one of my friends set up the  uh  get hub server and then another friend. I said ok  just try to focus on like the matching algorithms. Then I'll try to put all these things together and create  like  the front end of the website and bring all the code together and yeah. So that was my team experience.\", \"Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it? \": \"Uh  to overcome it  I am trying to be a better leader. Um  I am actually going through this leadership  uh  program right now. It's called CCLP  so that's been helping me a lot with my leadership skills.\", \"And why should we hire you? \": \"I think you should hire me because I have the necessary background experience. Um  from my past summers at  uh  Wells Fargo and also because I can get work done. I will work well on a team  but at the end of the day if things aren't getting done  I will over-compensate and do it myself. So  you can count on me to meet the deadlines necessary at your firm.\", \"So  how are you doin'?\": \"Um i am a junior in course 18 which is applied math. Uh  Obviously I go to MIT  uhm. whoops sorry.\", \"Mmhmm. So  please tell me about yourself.\": \"I'm also probably going to major in management science uhm  as well as I'm really interested in minoring in economics. Um outsie of academics I do a lot of sports  I play water polo  I rock clmb a lot  uhm I run and bike a lot and uh I'm involved in lots of random clubs at MIT so I like to keep busy. \", \"Mmhmm. Tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Oh  um  so I did a lot of uh  uh  coaching of younger kids  uhm  a lot of team management as in like setting up events  setting up meets  heping meets and everything running smoothly  uhm  as well as just leading   you know  cheers  helping people stay focus and stay organized at practices. \", \"Mmhmm. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a different challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Yeah  eventually\", \"Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.\": \" Uhm  because I'm a very fast learner. Um  I'm dedicated and I know how to work hard  because it's something that I've done for my entire life and  uh  I like being busy and I like working hard.  So if I'm given a task I'll work hard until its done well\", \"Now  why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Um we but we we didn't realize that it was not production ready and then . . .\", \"Oh  thank-\": \"Uhh  so I'm a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. \", \"So  Jay  please tell me about yourself.\": \"Umm  so right now I'm currently in the middle of my junior year. I'm looking for a summer internship company and uhh-\", \"Excellent. So uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"OK. Umm  so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE. \", \"Hm. That's all very interesting. So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem.\": \"Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine. Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers. Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasn't really able to do much. And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasn't showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who weren't sick uhh and basically help them communicate  talk to each other  and set up meetings. Uhh  I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project.\", \"Excellent. So  um  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge. How did you solve the problem?\": \"Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University.\", \"Um  this was  tell me about when you were  tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a challenge. \": \"Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms.\", \"How you solved the problem. So it's challenges and teamwork.\": \"So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other. Umm I was working with a partner  but in a larger context of umm a dozen students. Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project  uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design. Umm so that became a bit of an issue  umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed. Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up  up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV. And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there. Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us  the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program.\", \"Uh  very good. So  can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to improve upon it?\": \"Ummm  so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late. Umm this is actually probably after I'm used to after I'm used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that  and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed. So  I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what I'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time. It's something that I've tried to implement over the past couple weeks.\", \"That's very good. And so  think about a job that you'd like later. Why do you think we should hire you for this position?\": \"Umm I think you should hire me  because umm basically I've demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience  a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company. Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you.\", \"Thank you Jay  I appreciate you coming.\": \"Um  so I'm a junior at MIT. I'm in aerospace engineering. Um  I'm thinking of doing more of the  the aeronautics side rather than the astronautics side  although I don't have to decide until later. Um  I'm in ROTC and  you know  in the Air Force portion. I'm hoping to become a pilot. Uh  I applied pretty recently and I'll find out maybe in February or March of next year. Um  I'm also in Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity. Our house is on the East campus across the river and I've been living there since I was a sophomore. Um  that's  that's basically me.\", \"So  can you tell me about yourself?\": \"Um  so  probably the biggest chance I got to demonstrate leadership so far in my life has been this past summer when I went to pretty much ROTC's version of boot camp. It's called field training and it's about a month long and it's in Alabama. And it's pretty much a test to see what you'd do in really stressful situations. So  uh  they'd give us pretty big things like we'd have to be in charge of 40 or 50 people and we'd have to make sure they got to this place at the right time and then do um  I guess the correct action when we get there. And make sure nobody's going astray or making sure that like all the obstacles the instructors set up  uh  we can overcome them. So  being in charge of people for a good two or three days when everything is just so high stress is probably um  the most challenging leadership experience I've ever had.\", \"Excellent. Let me open my questions up here. So  uhm  can you tell of a time where you demonstrate leadership?\": \"Um  hm  to give I guess a non-ROTC-related example  um  as we have a decent amount of projects in um  Core 16 like Unified is  a lot  is very project based in the second semester and  um  one of the biggest problems we had in our specific group was the way that um  I guess  the work was being allocated. So at first  it was supposed to be um  very evenly divided so each person on the four-person team would do a quarter of the work. But  um  some people started doing a little bit less and some people started doing a little bit more. And by the middle of the semester  it was very unequal. And so  it was kind of getting  you know  under everyone's skin. So  as a group  after we um  we realized that it just wouldn't  it was really a detriment to our productivity  we all had a group meeting and said  listen  this is what we have to do. We have to reallocate the certain things that are um  are the parts of the project that um  we had  we wanted to originally and um  it just kind of went astray. So  we did that  and we became a lot better.\", \"Wow. So can you tell me about a time where you're working on a team and face a challenge? how did you go about resolving it?\": \"Um  working on a team  faced with a challenge. Um  hm. I can think of um  try to not um  hit the same categories. So um  in SAE  in the fraternity that I'm in  last semester I was the recruitment chair. So  the  the job for the recruitment chair is essentially to plan Rush. Like  plan our events for CPW  plan our events for fall rush  plan our events for spring rush for a full calendar year  or for a full school year  excuse me. Um  and  the question was challenges in a group  right?\", \"Ahh  that makes sense.\": \"Okay.\", \"Uhm  so  uh  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to over come it. \": \"So  challenges and teamwork. So  rush is very team-oriented because you're trying to work with your brothers to um  really see I guess  which freshmen uh  are the most compatible with your fraternity. And that you'd probably have the best time with. So  the way I set it up was we actually did work in small teams of about 4 or 5 brothers and we'd go out and you know  do fun things and meet freshmen. I would say the biggest problem with that during rush is that some teams were a lot more active than others. And the team that I was in  uh  was a little bit less active and  of course as being rush chair  I didn't want that to be the case. I wanted to change that. So  um  especially in situations where you don't have um  you don't have like hard  given  not given  but like outlined powers. Like you're not someone's boss. You're just like another brother in the fraternity. Um  the best kind of way to convince people to do something that you want to do is through positive motivation. So that's what I ended up using a lot to get for a while as rush chair to get people to go out. So it was all  always being like very excited to do it and like knowing that you're passionate about it and telling them  or and like having them realize that oh  this is a really good thing that we should be doing. And it will really help us out and it will be fun. So that's how I solved that problem.\", \"Mhmm. Uhm. Thanks. So I guess thinking  uhm  about a job that you like to apply for.\": \"So  my greatest weakness. I normally would probably have to think a lot more about. But  I actually had a similar conversation with um one of my bosses in ROTC about a month and a half ago. So  I would say my greatest weakness is when I get put in really stressful situations  I will tend to jump to a decision or a conclusion too quickly and won't necessarily think about  or  I think through the whole process um  like to fruition. I'll kind of like hurry up and want to get to something so  um  so the situation can be like  I guess resolved. So what I'm working on is just being able to like even in a stressful situation and I know it is a problem to kind of slow down and take a step back and really like at things kind of from a higher altitude. \", \"Uh  Why should we hire you for this position?\": \"Um  I'm a really hard worker. I absolutely will devote myself to um  this company. I  I think as a team member  I'm very cooperative. Uh  if the goal we have as a team  if I agree with it  and for the most part I will. And if I won't then I'll voice  and like I'll voice my concerns and try to make it something everyone can agree on. And if I agree on it  um  then I am or I'll definitely be able to participate in the team in a very productive manner. I'll be a very good follower and if  um  if it's needed I can be a very good leader as well.\", \"Ah  well thank you for coming.\": \"All right.\", \"Um  please tell me about yourself.\": \"Sure  so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science. Uhm  I'm really interested in the intersection of the two. So  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that I'm interested in doing. But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. \", \"So  I lived in Louisville.\": \"Sure  so  uhm  I guess I'd say earlier this year. So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. Uhm  and  the REX Event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to. So free housing. Uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend. \", \"Yeah.\": \"Um  uh  so I'm Rebecca. I'm a junior  uh  studying linguistics. Um  and I think I'm interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad.\", \"Anyway. So can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?\": \"Yep.\", \"Oh  that's all very excellent.\": \"Sure. So I think the  the problem  uhm  that I have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people. So  uhm  I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things. So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no. I think let's. you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when I graduate they're able to take on that role. \", \"So  can you tell me a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?\": \"Sure.\", \"So tell me one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Sure. I think uhm  I combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise. So  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is  uh  would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates  uhm  have. \", \"Excellent. So uh think of a job you'd like to get hired for  why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Thank you for having me.\", \"Excellent. Thanks again for coming again.\": \"Okay  um  my name's Evan  Evan Muray  I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science. I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky. And  uh  yeah I currently live across the river. I heard about this study through e-mail. So  thought I'd check it out.\", \"Of course!\": \"You did?\", \"So how are you?\": \"All right um  so in  I guess  the last time I can really remember being part of uh  really intense team experience was um  in high school  I was on the year book as a photographer. So um  we  I  my friend and I were both the head photographers. So we  organized all the photos. And so  we would coordinate with the editors. And um  in that they would tell us what sort of content we needed  like what events needed to have photos taken of them  or what teams needed photos. And  we would go about organizing the actual um  like the sending of the photographers to go to these events or to get the team photos. And  so um  there we times when  like just getting  making sure that our photographers got to events uh  and like  and end up getting a decent amount of good photos um  was  could be very challenging. Because  I mean  because we were all very busy students. And so um  one  like just  I guess one challenge we faced was just getting people to like  really commit to their job and follow through on that. And so  part of what we did was just try to build a really strong like  team culture. And  a sense of like  comradery among the photographers themselves. \", \"Doing well. So can you please tell me about yourself.\": \"A leader? Uh sure. Um. A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer. Um  and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization. Um  in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them. Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students  so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator  we usually work in tandem. The other activity is dance troop. It's another student organization here at MIT  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  it's a dance show  and I'm a choreography for that organization as well. I lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun.\", \"Excellent. I went to MIT myself.\": \"Thanks.\", \"0-6. \": \"Sure  uh  I think a great example of that would be this past January  I participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours. It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. We had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening  active listening. I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. And by doing that  um  I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  I mean  we needed to get through it.\", \"Anyway  I'd like to ask you about your leadership experiences. Can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?\": \"My greatest weakness... Hm. Okay. Uh. I'd say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  I'd say  probably uh  self-starting  actually. It's something I've been working  it's like my goal for this year  to work on. In the past I would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes. If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT  is if you have an idea just go for it. It's very easy  especially here  there's resources to do so  and  it's something that I want to work on  I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own. It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects. But  this  I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences.\", \"Excellent. So you can about a time when you were working on a team and faced another challenge  how did you resolve it?\": \"Uh  I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to MIT for example  I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science. Many of my past internships  I've been going to  I don't have much experience  but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. I find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  I can get to work on using that sort of technology. In the past couple internships  I've had to deal with new languages  new framework  and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking.\", \"Another challenge  just not that particular one.\": \"No problem  thank you for having me.\", \"Yes.\": \"--but we found that our levels of technical skill were really different. It was her first time working in any sort of lab--\", \"Excellent. Can you tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"So uh my name's Bonnie. I'm a junior at MIT. I'm in core six which if you don't know is in computer science. I'm minoring in economics umm also mathematics. So I'm interested in you know application of data and quantitative reasoning to any sort of like interesting fields so  that includes like economics  finance  biology. So a vary wide array of interests. And I'm here today because well I was uh  told it would be a good time here with the behavior study.\", \"Ah  that makes sense. So uh think about a job you would like to have  why should we hire you for this job?\": \"Oh what year were you?\", \"Excellent  well thank you again for coming.\": \"Okay.\", \"I'm well  Thanks for coming. So please tell me about yourself?\": \"Okay  so I'd say one fairly informal instance actually was over this last spring break. A couple friends and I  four of us actually  so a fairly small group  um  we biked from Philadelphia to Boston over spring break because we thought that would be a good idea. What it actually was  huh  there were some amazing ups  some amazing downs. umm  Definitely a very memorable experience. And there were just some points over the course of the trip when it was 45 degrees except your biking on the state highways  it's raining  and like ??? so we felt like giving up a little bit  just heading back up  taking the train. And I really riled people up in terms of reminding us why we were doing this and reminding us of the fact that we were already 60% of the way through we might as well push on all the way to the end of our journey. Just like I guess evoking everyone's different motivation because everyone you know wants to do something awesome  but everyone has a slightly different motivation for why they join a team in the first place. And I guess providing like individualized reasons and individualized motivations to uh you know different parts of our team as to why they came on in the first place and why that's still something that resonates with them. And using that you know I was able to get the group back together and we did bike all the way back up here. So that was a very rewarding experience.\", \"Mhmm\": \"Um  I think I'm definitely a leader  I am willing to take charge of a situation um in a group of people. I'm not afraid to stand  out or have my opinions heard; um and on the flip-side I'm not afraid to suffer consequences if uh there's any sort of negative outcome or negative or positive outcome I'm willing to handle um the results.\", \"That's good.\": \"Oh  oh  another challenge. \", \"Thanks. So  I'm gonna ask you some questions I'd like to ask.\": \"Okay. Um  well let's see  most of the challenges I've seen coming in any sort of team work right involve either internal challenges  something that's coming from within the team  or an external challenge. So I guess if we were to talk about an external challenge  umm  something not involving you know lack of motivation  uhh  it would  uh  let's see. So uh  so my  my freshman year I was involved  uh  I was involved in this organization called tech fair where we basically organized a um a tech expo at the beginning of the uh  beginning of the school year. And I was  again I was  I was able to motivate people towards the end when there was a lot of work happening  a lot of twelve-hour days to get the logistics down before the event. And I guess again there it uh it does come down to really motivating people  um and speaking to their individual you know passions to get them to you know do things which they might not want to and short cut.\", \"So  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um  my greatest weakness I've noticed can be a uh lack of  lack of focus. Especially if I have like a large number of tasks  it's very easy to instead of you know caching away all my other tasks somewhere and focusing on one at a time. It's very easy for me to you know pop one but still have you know like subtasks and the other things I have to do running in my mind. Um  so of late  I've been trying to basically get more organized. I've you know had this hypothesis that by using a Google calendar  Google this  Google that  all these other products to try you know serve as fairly intelligent places where I can hash away my uh  my other tasks. It will provide me with something which is very trustworthy that I will trust enough to not what worry about those tasks. Because what usually happens  right  I just write it down on a piece of paper. Um I don't trust that I'll be able to find and the risk of forgetting to do something important is  is pretty great to bear. So that  that's been pretty useful so far. I've noticed that I've had an urge sometimes to think about other things I have to do  but I just remind myself that wait wait you wrote that down there. You probably knew what you were doing  so don't worry about that. There's a supervisor which is yourself taking care of your other tasks.\", \"uh-huh  excellent. So tell me about a time that you were working in a team and were faced with a challenge. How did you go about solving the problem?\": \"Good  How are you doing?\", \"Excellent. uhm  so uhh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Uhh  So my name is Skylar Shieto  I'm a junior currently here at MIT. I'm studying course 18 mathematics  uhmm  currently enjoying it alot  uhmm  classes I'm currently taking not so much.\", \"Ah  interesting.\": \"Uhmm  I don't know  Is there anything in particular you want to know?\", \"Mhmm  so now thinking of a job that you'd like to have  you got one in mind?\": \"Ok. \", \"No? Well just think of something. Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Ok.\", \"So are you thinking of being a mathematician. (laughs)\": \"Uhmm  ok  so I was over at Ip I did book reports.\", \"Fair enough  well cool. \": \"Uhmm  I kind of assumed like a project mangerish role  particularly because I wasn't really familiar with Python too much  which is the coding language that they used to test.\", \"Ah  excellent. Well thanks for coming in today.\": \"Uhmm  so I assumed more of a director kind of doing the math for it and kind of instructing people to do the mathematical thinking for that kind of thing.\", \" How are you\": \"Uhmm  Let me see  I usually take this particular example. One of the tough things is you having to explain things that are sort of  something that is very familiar to you to someone who doesn't have familiarity with that and  especially in a really short time. Uhh  can be extremely difficult. Uhmm  It's how to deal with that. Uhh  sort of just by giving a crash course  uhm  kind of asking other friends to also help  so it's uhmm  kind of give some information and ask for feedback  that sort of thing.\", \" Excellent.  So  uh  please tell me about yourself.\": \"ok  uhh  let's see  one of my weaknesses uhhm  technical writing  uhmm  and what I'm doing to overcome that. Actually not very much  I'm taking a math writing class.\", \" Mhm.  Now I'm going to ask you a series of questions  um  starting out with tell me a time where you demonstrate leadership\": \"Uh  so that's been really helpful. It's in a subject that I really enjoy   and I actually have a paper due this Friday so hopefully I show so improvement and that would help.\", \" Tell me a time where you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.  How did you end up solving the problem\": \"Uhmm  not particularly. Sorry.\", \" Hm\": \"ackground)\", \" mm\": \"uh  wouldn't be too bad. (laughs)\", \" Oh good.\": \"I think this is also the sort of place where I can do things that are in my interest  uhmm  like statistics or computer science.Those sort of things.\", \" Mhm  so uh  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to improve upon it.  \": \" I'm doing well\", \" Well that's always a good practice.  \": \" Uh  I'm a student  I study computer science.  Uh  I'm in my last year so when I graduate in May I'm going to be working on computer science stuff\", \" So now  thinking about a job that you\\u2019d like to have  do you have one in mind?\": \" I demonstrate leadership on the track team  I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh  seniors on the team myself included uh   lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to...to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that.\", \" So now  why should we hire you?\": \" Hm... in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn\\u2019t have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group.  So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out.  So that was pretty rough  but this happened like a year ago.  So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices  like there's just no way. And like then it dominoes  which was a huge problem.  \", \" Ah  excellent.  Well thanks for coming today.\": \" And a lot of people suggested a lot of different...a lot of different solutions.  Most of them were like motivated from anger.\", \"So  please tell me about yourself.\": \"Um  well as you probably know  I'm a Junior in MIT  ah material science and engineering  and i've spent a bit of time doing some research in material science  but i've also recently declared a maj-  ah  minor in course two. Which is  sorry  its mechanical engineering. Umm  so  I'm looking for a bit of practice in industry. Now that I've had some research experience  I've a lot of range of classes in engineering. \", \"Oh  yes.\": \" But  but we worked it out to a... it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh  we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room.  So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more  but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh  could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money.  So  so we kept some of the people we kicked out.\", \"Most definitely. So can you tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership?\": \" Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed.\", \"Sorry to hear that. So  can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team  and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?\": \" Uh  I'm the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized.  My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side.  Um  so  so  it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ?  I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that I've been on that I had to leave  uh  the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like don't just tell you to document just to aggravate you.  So  I worked uh  so like since then like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it.  So that like there\\u2019s some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it.  So just to like read my documentation that and which I've never done before until this most recent project had that problem\", \"So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you\\u2019ve done to overcome it. \": \" Yeah\", \"Excellent  thank you. Um  so I guess my last question is  thinking of a job that you\\u2019d like to have- do you have one in mind?\": \" Sure  yeah\", \"So now  why do you think we should hire you?\": \" Mostly because uh  results.  I'm  I just like get things done.  And there\\u2019s a like  there's a lot of things I know how to do  especially the job I'm thinking of is like a programming job like a startup.  My background  my degree is actually nuclear engineering.  SO  so like I don't have like the background the internships the stuff like that.  A lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask I don't know  which is pretty rough  but uh I  I think that I would be  I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I'd do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer  being more resourceful  and stuff like that.  So like  I   I feel like I could get more results then somebody who has the same  or somebody who has a better background\", \"Oh  well thank you. I appreciate your coming today.\": \"So my name is Fernando Iber  I am a junior here  I come from Puerto Rico  and I am currently studying biological engineering. Uh  I\\u2019m considering doing pre-medicine  maybe going into either an MD  and  let\\u2019s say  apply to some schools as an MD  or go into an MD-PHD program. Um  my main interest is basically oncology  but  like  I  over the past few years I\\u2019m doing a couple of research programs  I did an internship  and it basically  like  gave me a view that I could tackle that problem in a lot of ways. So not just being a clinician  but being a researcher  a medical researcher.\", \"So please tell me about yourself.\": \"Myself  um  I'm a junior majoring in computer science at MIT I'm very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses.  I want to pursue (?) everyone.\", \"Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve the problem.\": \"So  I actually have a really humbling experience. Last semester I took a class about mechanics. A lot of people in that class were juniors and I was a sophomore. So everybody there was much more experienced than me  so I was the only sophomore in my group  there were two ones that were juniors  and it was the final project. And when we sat down and started talking about things to do  I basically had almost no knowledge of the things they were planning  \\u2018cause they already took cell biology  and they took really advanced courses in fluid dynamics  and they were trying to do some tissue modeling. Like  even though it was a class about mechanics  and I could understand some of the things  I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. And they just put me there  and one of them was really helpful  and actually guided me through the initial process  but the other one was not available at all  at any time. So I basically had to sit down  I actually met with the professor a couple of times  just to  like  talk and chat  and we took the professor out for  for a lunch  so we could just  like  talk about stuff  and I actually had to find out my own way through everything  with a little help of the only junior friend that was actually available to me. And it was humbling because normally when I worked on teams  we were all pretty equal  equal minded  or it was in a humanities class. \\u2018Cause normally technical classes here don\\u2019t have much to do with team projects in sophomore year. Normally laboratories and final design project classes are for older students  so it was a surprise for me where it came  like  I\\u2019m a sophomore  and I\\u2019m already doing final presentations for bio-mechanics. And it just caught me pretty off guard. And the only way\\u2026we ended up doing an extremely awesome project  but it took lots of coffee  Red Bull  and Wikipedia. That\\u2019s my strategy for now  \\u2018cause it was completely new territory right there  compared to humanities or any other classes where you\\u2019re  everybody has the same mindset. So that was my group trauma. \", \"Tell me about one of your weaknesses.  What do you plan to do to overcome it?\": \"So I didn\\u2019t have any actually trouble self-recognizing trouble about  so stemming off of  from the inexperience type of situation  that was actually the first group project I had where that experience happened  and I feel like if I get into something that I don\\u2019t  basically  know  I have a really hard time finding stuff out for myself. So if I don\\u2019t come prepared to do something  it takes me a while to get to a pace to actually start absorbing material and actually contributing  which is kind of a handicap  because some students are already up to speed and they already expect some things from me. And I  I  I obviously would like to give them my all and hand out everything they want on a silver platter  but it\\u2019s hard for me. So I\\u2019ve been trying  so basically  like  the solution for me was basically studying more  putting much more effort from my part  but it\\u2019s still a big  a big minus in my  in my turf. It\\u2019s  uh  it takes me a while to dominate things that  that I don\\u2019t have an up-to-speed inclination to that. And that has caused  like  mishaps that  well  through hard work you can overcome them  but a lot of work  compared to your regular person. \", \"Well  thank you.\": \"So I feel like  even though I\\u2019ve gone through many obstacles  I\\u2019ve always tried and found a way to excel  exert myself to bigger than I\\u2019d previously thought. So I might sometimes feel that I don\\u2019t have that knowledge on me  but I will go out and get it  even if it takes a lot of coffee or a lot of effort  because there\\u2019s also a sense of satisfaction in actually giving it more than you can  but seeing that actually succeed. You know what I mean? It\\u2019s  uh  it\\u2019s like what MIT does to you  you\\u2019re humbled by an immense amount of work  you\\u2019re humbled by  by extremely hard classes that you had no idea that they were going to come and blast you with pieces  homework  and exams that you are overwhelmed. But you sit down  you think about stuff. I sit down and I think about stuff  and I get a plan there. That  the good thing about the plan  it takes some time to devise a plan  because it  it\\u2019s not as efficient  it\\u2019s not efficient to go randomly guessing what to do  but  but  having  like an educated guess  you remember the SAT\\u2019s  where it\\u2019s like \\u201cyou may not always know the answer  but you can make an educated guess as to what the answer may be.\\u201d So that\\u2019s how I approach things when I have no idea what I\\u2019m doing  but after some effort it will actually get me to a place where I can say \\u201chey  I\\u2019m here  let\\u2019s get crackin\\u2019.\\u201d Um  that\\u2019s sort of  like  the general mindset I have for many problems  be it the life sciences  you have to do an essay  if I have to come up with elucidating a mechanism that does this to breast cancer cells  or if I go by  the walks of life can take you anywhere  if I end up being a consultant for a  for Johnson and Johnson  let's say  a company for random purposes  and  it's the same way you tackle every problem. You get up and you find out what you have a hard time doing  then you sit down and do it. Uh  sometimes it's frustrating  because results don't come out like this  um  but I feel like once you get the hang of it  you can start  your productivity increases by x-fold  x be a number  much higher than one  let's talk MIT here. Yeah  I feel that's the  that's at least my way of tackling things and it's gotten me through a lot  and it's actually helped me wear down the walls of MIT and have a better experience at it  so I feel it's the same way I should attack all the problems that come to me. \", \"excellent. so tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"A time when I demonstrated leadership was  um  I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip.  And  um  some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially.  And by  um  by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people  what was going on in people's lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time  we were able to have a successful trip.\", \"Tell me a time when you worked in a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve the problem?\": \"Um  a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur? Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem.  And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didn't deny anyone's idea off the bat  we just tried to be as creative as we could be.  And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem.\", \"Interesting\": \" One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion.  But it's  I find it's a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible.  So fail fast  essentially.  That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project. \", \"So can you tell me one of your weaknesses? and what are you doing to overcome it?\": \"Why I think you should hire me.  I think you should hire me because I'm very  I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work.  I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.\", \"Now think about a job that you would like to have. Why should we hire you?\": \"myself umm I don\\u2019t know how much you know from any sort of registration or anything I am Young. I am Junior right now. I am in my third year. I am I guess I talk about what I am majoring umm I am majoring in mathematics and physics. I am also doubling in core six computer science. and umm I think I am getting minor in French and French literature. grew up in the states in northern virginia. Growing up I guess I was interested in I played a lot of competitive chess. I was also interested in recreationally tennis and soccer. and um other forms of\", \"How are you?\": \" \\u2018K.  I think for me \\u2013 \", \"Hm\": \"of course it\\u2019s not a life threatening challenge\", \" Excellent. So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"weaknesses umm I guess one weakness would be being very honest with myself in terms of trying to determine what I want to do and focusing all my faculty on that. Rather than keeping ones options open which I think a good thing. but I think umm sometimes it can be an excuse for not taking risks. this is important because where I went to high school. The culture was very pervasive of trying to do everything and in great part it causes you not to commit to any one thing. which in one way could be good in terms of keeping your options open. but on the other hand if you knew if you had known what you want to do specifically and devoted all your resources to that specifically of course you could do better than that. and in the end you probably go to pick something. I think one weakness is to be honest with myself about what specifically I want to do and devote resources to that. umm what I am trying to do to address that. it may seem at the beginning umm somewhat paradoxical. but what I\\u2019ve been doing is trying out wide variety of things so I can\\u2019t use the excuse. there are bunch of things I don\\u2019t know yet. I\\u2019ll keep my options open. I\\u2019ll try them out and if I don\\u2019t like them I\\u2019ll drop. that\\u2019s a way to decide what\\u2019s left to do that I\\u2019d like.\", \"Excellent. So  it sounds like you have worked on a lot of teams. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?\": \"alright so it\\u2019s still early in terms of job search but one job that I would like that I am considering is trading umm trading or some sort of quantitative finance. and umm I think I\\u2019d be a strong candidate because I have an extremely strong quantitative background in mathematics and modeling umm computer science work I\\u2019ve done physics as well. and umm I have history of being competitive both in academic environment and in chess and in other sports. I have always known. especially if we the role we are talking about a trader trading I have always been interested in strategy games such as chess poker etc. trying to find an optimal strategy and use it to win the game. and that I think the kind of skillset that is necessary for this kind of job.\", \"Ah  that\\u2019s  uh  very good. So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you\\u2019ve done to overcome it.\": \"Fine\", \"That makes since. So  uh  uh  think about the job you\\u2019d like to have. Might be a rep or something else. Do you have something in mind? \": \"Uh  I\\u2019m Daniel. I\\u2019m a Freshman.\", \"O good  yeah  OK.. So now  why do you think we should give you this job?\": \"I\\u2019m from  uh  Fort Lauderdale  Florida. Thinking about course AN61 here. I  uh  actually  uh  I was here for running  but I realized it wasn\\u2019t me  so  um  I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon. So  um  yeah  classes I am doing fine. Looking for a job now. That\\u2019s about it.\", \"Ah  well  thank you for your time. I appreciate you coming in and interviewing today.\": \"Uh  I\\u2019d say  probably  I\\u2019d say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration. I was  um  senior in my  in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing? I\\u2019d really  like  thought it showed them that  like  even though I wasn\\u2019t put in the best situation  like  I performed indiscriminately. And  I think  in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even  like  half the season we were always like around the same time. And  we ended up  uh  medaling at states. And I\\u2019d say that  um  a good part of that is by leading by example by the older  um  upper classmen  so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership.\", \"Tell me about yourself.\": \"eat. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\", \"That's great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"I think one of my weaknesses has to be  um  the fact that  I\\u2019m a little  um  delinquent with my work. And  uh  um  I\\u2019m lazy at times. I definitely procrastinate. It was a pursuing thing through high school. And  uh  it\\u2019s still a little now because of a passing record. One of my combating is goal setting. I learned it from one of my  uh  from one of these  one of an upperclassmen that I know in  uh  at MIT. He  uh  told me  like  to write out  like  weekly goals and write out long term goals. Like  long terms goals meaning  like  the end of MIT  after MIT  what you want to do after the MIT experience  and short term goals  which is  like  get stuff done now. So  in a way that kind of put me things  put things in perspective for me. Realize that I shouldn\\u2019t be burning too much time messing around. By  I mean  certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because it\\u2019s  it\\u2019s a good time to have fun and relax. But  at the same time  I shouldn\\u2019t do it in excess. So  I guess that\\u2019s helped me a little bit. \", \"Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?\": \"Um  actually  yeah  um. I\\u2019ve never had lab experience before  so I really want a role  which is why-\", \"Okay. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Okay.\", \"Great. And why do you think we should hire you? What it is [??] medical school?\": \"Um  well  I was born in Nigeria.  Um  and I moved to the United States at the age of eight  um and lived here  um  in Boston actually ever since.  Um  and um  for as long as I remember umm I've always wanted to go into the medical field. Umm I've always wanted to be a doctor  and just recently actually discovered that I wanted to be a pediatrician umm after working with kids and doing a lot of babysitting in high school and have actually umm shadowed a neonatologist and I feel like that was when it clicked that I actually really want to be a pediatrician.  Umm and I've tutored a lot  umm middle school and high school  and that's really like affirmed the fact that I do like my career.  I want it to be something where I work with kids.\", \"So tell me about yourself.\": \"Team...faced a challenge. Umm. Okay  umm I guess back to the student group. Umm so this is the second time I've actually been on the executive board. Umm the first  umm  last year the executive board ran really smoothly. We worked well together but this year we...we're kind of having problems 'cause it's a new set of people so it's kind of hard adjusting umm to the people I'm working with. Umm so you know  we all have different viewpoints  different ways of approaching things. Umm  so we had a lot of loss of communication  which kind of hindered umm our uh progress this year umm but in the past few weeks we've been able to kind of figure out that  you know  there's been a loss of communication  and we should definitely  like  you know  we need to figure out how to stop that barrier and learn more to communicate more in order to get the things that we want accomplished done.\", \"Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"My weaknesses...umm. I think my biggest weakness is not knowing when to say no. I'm the kind of person that  if someone asks me to do something even if I feel like it's impossible I always say yes. Umm and I've always...I think I realized that problem when I came at MIT and I've been working on that ever since my sophomore year umm and I'm a junior right now. Umm and what I've been doing to overcome it is kind of schedule myself. Umm I have my calendar. I live by my calendar  and I know if it doesn't fit on my calendar  if it's overlapping with something  then absolutely no  I can't do it. So I live by my calendar now and it's definitely helping me say no to things when people ask me to do things for them.\", \"Oh  wow.\": \"[laughs] Umm. I think that I am a good asset. Umm  one  because MIT experience has definitely prepared me for  I would say  the worst  umm because of the experience as an MIT student. So  it's a unique experience  umm but I've also umm gained a lot of umm a broad range of academic skills  umm not just in  in the life sciences but also in engineering field and political science field umm that I think I can bring into the medical field umm with the help of the knowledge that I gain in medical school to kind of help the world  which is want I want to do  ultimately. So I think umm I would be a good asset for the medical field.\", \"Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?\": \"Umm so I'm a junior at MIT  i'm a math major  umm i have experience in both the economic side of thing's and uhh cs  simple coding   umm interested in going into probably analytic's or trading in the future.\", \"Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?\": \"Um  so I am the co-president of an organization at MIT called Glo-Met  and what we do is  we're partnered with a non-profit gratitude organization abroad  so our group is basically non profit. We work with HIV health care work in Togo  and so I guess an example of leadership would be this whole semester I suppose  it's been a work in progress  it's the first time I've ever been like in a president's role in a group of about 30 people. And all the records are new this year  its a new organization. So it's sort of like realizing  you know there's so many aspects of leadership  it's not just like  not only the objectives your group needs to get done but also the camaraderie you have in a group and we can show that's being maintained properly. Um and we had a lot of really troublesome leadership experiences last year with this group. Um so I guess I've been learning a lot. Do you have specific questions about that?\", \"Great.  Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Okay  umm so I guess I'm also a member of China Development Initiative  and so a lot of times  umm  when were in events most of them are within our own group so were brainstorming for like service leadership programs and stuff like that.  But umm we also try to do some events where we bring in professors and other speakers. So some of the big challenges we face include umm actually finding these speakers  getting them to really correspond with us.  Like sometimes they'll respond and be like oh  were interested  but then they just don't follow up  so going after them  kinda looking for that response.\", \"This company that does analytic's?\": \"okay  umm I would say I'm generally more of a passive person  when someone gives me a task I'll do it I won't really  like if i get stuck I'll kind of try to keep working on it myself instead of asking for help.\", \"OK. Good. Tell me about yourself. \": \"Umm so I've been trying to umm  i guess talk to more higher ups  if i run into issues  or ask more questions i guess.\", \"Mm.\": \"You know you can learn . You knew wanna be teens etc. But it was like despite not knowing anything about mechanical engineering I was able to sort of understand and learn um sort of graduate to eventually becoming um . . .\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"as a researcher  but not as a doctor. And I would visit him at work and I was always attracted to the hospital side...\", \"Oh  OK.\": \"--and in order to hide that  I also  you know  channel the stress in different ways  such as like looking around  perhaps a lot of intrusive movement with my hands or my body  um and also speaking  being long-winded and speaking too much in order to cover that up. So  I think that just being more comfortable with speaking um in the higher pressure situation  such as public speaking  or in an interview! [Laughs]\", \"Mm-hmm. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and face a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \". . . to do. And  I kept getting  like  frustrated because a lot of my experiments  they wouldn't work  and I felt really bad. [??] And then  uh  I also  like  volunteer at a hospital just to  like  gain experience and see what it's like. And  uh  I enjoy helping people. So  I think  decided for sure now [??] school.\", \"Yeah. How did you resolve that problem?\": \"\", \"Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \". . . in how to organize a team. So  like  after our first year  like  our sophomore year together  we  like  like  had a  like a sit down discussion afterwards . . .  \", \"Mm-hmm  that's great. Um  why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"So the next year we  we have  like  uh  we implemented  like  uh  daily meetings. So  like  before we would  like  split up for the day and  like  work on our  uh  work on our robot. We would  like  outline a plan and then  like  show it to everyone . . . \", \"So  how are you doing today?\": \"Uh  I'm an MIT undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering. And  I'm doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate  um  in an area other than mechanical engineering. I chose building technology and I'm hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well.\", \"Tell me about a time you\\u2019ve demonstrated leadership.\": \"So I used to  I used to tutor  like  young children at the Cambridge Community Center and teach them how to read. Um  and I'm currently doing the  like  tutoring  I mean  not tutoring  the AP [??] teaching. You know  um  so I'm  like  motivated to help people. Um  and I think that  like  as  especially as the world becomes  like  bigger  or the population gets greater  more and more people  like  will need medical help. So  I think being a doctor would be a good  good way to help people. \", \"Yeah  that\\u2019d be great.\": \"I'm doing very well  thanks. How are you?\", \"Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Uh I think one of my main weaknesses is  uh  taking on too many little things. Umm so sometimes not realizing  uh  what the little things are that I can let go for a little bit  and prioritizing  uh  large period of times of saying yes to too many things. Uh and what I'm mainly trying to do to change that is just keeping track of exactly how I spend my time. So recently Ive been really trying to focus in on  how long am I really wasting on little tasks  and how long I'm actually spending on larger tasks  um and I  and seeing that is very helpful  uh  in changing how I prioritize things\", \"Great. Tell\\u2026Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you\\u2019re doing to overcome it?\": \"\", \"Wow  great! Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"\", \"So you basically restarted the whole thing?\": \"lso try to think of something else if you don\\u2019t mind giving me just a minute.\", \"Great. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Umm  so I guess  in one of my classes last year  we had a team project where certain elements of it were things that none of three of us on the team knew how to do or were particularly interested in learning how  umm  and the way we kind of resolved that issue  because clearly  as an aspect  it needed to get done  we resolved that by making sure the person who took that had less responsibilities elsewhere to kind of balance it out. So the girl who took that was happy because her main priority was spending less time  whereas for the rest of us  we were more interested in the actual material  so we found a mutually agreeable solution.\", \"Great. Tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Yes. Umm  I think one of my weaknesses is that I tend to get very excited about everything I\\u2019m doing  you know  that  like  I\\u2019m a double major because I started in computer science and then I went oh  management really excites me too  I want to do that as well  which  in the past  has led me to kind of overextend myself a little bit  which  as a result  when you\\u2019re really excited about everything  but then you try to do everything  the amount of commitment you give to each one is reducing  but I\\u2019m conscious of this year. I cut down a little bit on my extracurriculars and\\u2026especially because last year  while doing all of those  I wasn\\u2019t sleeping as much  which  you know  while I was still there and pulling my share and everything  you know  it was harder to be a full present member of anything if you\\u2019re tired. So this year I kind of focused in on the things that were most important to me and I\\u2019m aware of that  so when I feel myself reaching my limit  I\\u2019ll actually try to prioritize more.\", \"Something along the lines of something relevant to what you'd want to hear.\": \"Good.\", \"Good  me too. Tell me about yourself.\": \"Mmhmm\", \"Tell me about the time you're on a team and faced a challenge. And how did you solve that problem?\": \"Haha\", \"Great. And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Great [laughs] tired.\", \"And why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"Uh  yeah [laughs]\", \"So  how are you doing?\": \"And um there were four people on the team to program. Whereas there was me who was kind of like I know how to do it but you know I I could do with more instruction.\", \"Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership. \": \"And to work for it  you know  things don't come very easy  so.\", \"Tell me about a time you were working a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve the problem?\": \"I am a huge perfectionist. So  you know  you [inaudible] into trivial things that  you know  you know  I shouldn't waste so much time perfecting and I- I will  so. That's- that's probably the worst thing. My boyfriend tells me all the time  he's like You have to stop expecting everything to be perfect I'm like I know  so. Uh  just trying to  like  put things in perspective I guess  so.\", \"Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it?\": \"Definitely became harder to do at MIT. You know  you can't be perfect because  you know  everyone here essentially is  so. Everyone's very good at doing stuff  so.\", \"Well  thank you again for coming.\": \"I\\u2019m doing good. How are you?Thank you. \", \"Yes  it was great to meet you.\": \"Well  um  my name is Jeff  um. I was born in Japan. I lived there for seven years before I moved to the  uh  US. First  to Michigan for two years and then to Maryland. Um  and it was when I was in high school  or I\\u2019m sorry  middle school that I was exposed to um  a lot of different math  uh  science  advanced science courses. Um  it was where  um  I was exposed to a lot of um math competitions and computer science competitions. And  it was around my uh  junior year in high school. It was around my junior year in school because of peer and parental pressures I decided to do pre-med. I decided to pursue  uh  a career in medicine. Um  so it was in high school that I decided start taking biology classes  physics  physiology  and  um  when I got here to MIT I decided to major in Course 20. Um  and  after about four lab positions  two of the (inaudible) and two of chemistry that I realized  um  the Course 20  the medicine track wasn\\u2019t for me. Um  mainly because it wasn\\u2019t quantitative enough or competitive enough  or fast paced enough for me. But  with my last internship in the biotech industry  I had the privilege of talking to talk with several site directors. Um  it was because of and through that meeting I realized that I might really like finance  and that it might be more suitable for me. Um  and afterwards I started talking to some colleagues. Um  some finance majors. And  that\\u2019s why I\\u2019m here. \", \"Gooood  tell me about yourself.\": \"Ok  well I would like to talk about my past at my most recent internship at a biotech company. Um  and the problem was that I was working as an individual group. It was because I was working with cells. And  cells  the way cells work  is that um  that you culture them  like on say day 1. And  you let them grow like four or five or six  and then you let them grow until you collect  data. And  the problem is you\\u2019re not even can\\u2019t collect the data on day one  you have to collect on day six. And  if anything happens on day 3 or day four or something or sometime between day one and day five  the data will make no sense. You would have to re-start the experiment. And  I was on a tight schedule and this was a ten week project. And  in the first two weeks  I contaminated the cells. Um  both weeks  um. And  so my data had to be re-done  my experiment had to be re-done. The problem was that this was a ten week project and I had eight weeks to do. One thing I learned about internships is to not panic when situations like such as this arise. And  uh  what I did was  I went to people for help. Um  and I definitely spent more hours. I talked to the HR department  I talked to my managers to increase my hours from 40 to 60 hours. Uh  so instead I went Saturdays and Sundays too. In fact  there was this one point where I worked 23 days in a row  um. And  uh  successfully  I think finished it. In fact  after my data analysis and data compiling  uh  I presented my data to the site director. He told me I had the most impressive presentation out of all the 21 other interns there. Um  So  Yeah  it was during challenges like that  because of challenges like that that I\\u2019ve learned to not panic in a stressful situation and to definitely branch out for help. \", \"Mhm.\": \"Ummm  definitely. So I'm president of The Undergrad Society of Learner Math and this basically gives me a great opportunity to  um  kind of help underclassmen and  also  younger girls  so those in highschool  middle school and kind of get them to become more active in the math community um participate in more events  even networking things  so  uh  anything with companies but also research with professors. It's a great way to kind of help other people who haven't really seen those opportunities yet.\", \"So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity. \", \"No  I want to hear about your experience.\": \" Good  how are you?\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you're working on a team a face a challenge  how do you solve that problem?\": \"Um  and so sort of that influenced me a lot. So then I realized  after doing biology for two years essentially  that I wasn't really enjoying it (laughs). And so  I decided to try out computer science. Because this is MIT after all and if I did want to do biology in the future  which it's not that I don't like biology  it's that I didn't feel like I was learning skills that would contribute to the field I guess. And so  um yeah.\", \"Okay. And why do you think we should hire you?\": \"And I play cello in the orchestra and I'm a part of Sigma Kappa.\", \" Tell me about yourself\": \"Even if that seems easier. Umm and then also like  maintaining the motivation among a group of people that are like really busy with other things in their lives. So that's the biggest challenge I think  but.\", \" Ready?  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Umm... so I guess the same organization  we had a lot of umm  problems. Um  so  we are a team as an organization. So last year I was like a director on the exec board  but not umm one of the co-presidents  and the biggest challenge we've had as a team was that our co presidents were not motivated  had very poor communication  and we didn't have  we just didn't really get anything done. Umm so a challenge on my part was not really  I wasn't sure  I knew what needed to get done and I knew things like we needed to be more efficient and take more initiative and you know  motivate our staff  because it's not like  it's not just about us  we obviously  there are people that like depend on us.. and umm  the problem was like not stepping on their toes at the same time  while trying to.. trying to get them motivated but you know  telling  and I think a challenge was that they felt it was  they felt personally attacked when people criticize them. Or when people try to make suggestions for better things to do umm so I think solving that problem was more just stepping back and being like you can't do everything  if that person is the president you just have to let them do what they're gonna do and wait til your ends do your job right  but don't try to push  like you can't always push through things  sometimes you gotta just like go.\", \"mm wow ok tell me about a time when working on a team and facing a challenge  how did you solve that problem?\": \"And like... and I guess that's... that did kind of solve the problem. I mean  I didn't solve the problem of like  things not getting done. But like I think realizing that actually helps a lot. Because it was just like banging your head against the wall. So.. yeah! (Laughs)\", \"ok and can you tell me one of your weaknesses that hopefully will never come in?\": \"That's like also a weakness I guess.. I guess a weakness of mine would be that I am pretty umm.. Knowing how to step back and not umm.. basically not trying to do everything myself when it's definitely supposed to be a team effort  and that involves a lot of like trust in other people and their competency. So umm... definitely giving people the chance to do the job right. And sometimes you make second chances. So I think that's.. I might have a bad temper sometimes. That can be part of it (laughs). So yeah.\", \"and what are you doing to overcome it?\": \"I think because I'm very motivated. And I have a lot of self initiative and I'm hard on myself  so that sometimes I expect highly of other people in the same way  and that can  I mean that is part of both the challenge and the weakness question that you've asked about  but I think that is umm good in  when you have a team of people and like you need somebody that umm is very meticulous about delegating things properly and making sure things are done at the right time. And somebody who really takes like  self responsibility for things. So.. I think if it's for like a project for example  like a small group project its like good to have someone that isn't shy to speak up in a group. And somebody that can sort of like organize the group to  to coordinate the group better. Like vocally. (Laughs)\", \"and why do you think we should hire you\": \" I am in aerospace and engineering  and a  \", \"(finishes sentence) in the meaning\": \"I\\u2019m in naval ROTC  and I\\u2019m trying to be a naval  \", \"great\": \"\", \"Ok.

Ok  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you\\u2019re doing to overcome it?\": \"we do really hope that the project was good \", \"Mmm hmm\": \"Yes  I definitely do think I'm a leader. Um  one of the global poverty - er - one of the organizations I'm involved with on campus is the Global Poverty Initiative and I'm currently their Director of Action. And what that means is I'm leading a student group of about twenty people and - um - under the Action branch of the whole organization - and what we do is - in the Action branch - is work on projects on a global scale. So  we have projects currently in India and projects in mexico. And my job is to coordinate these projects and work on what communities we want to go work in and what types of technology related projects we'd like to pursue. And I've been involved with this organization for two and a half years now  and have been the director of Action for the past two years.\", \"Great. And why do you think you should get into this medical school?\": \"One of my big weaknesses would be ah  \", \"Mmmmm\": \"front of a lot of people\", \"So uh  how are you doing today?\": \"\", \"I'm well. Um  please tell me about yourself.\": \"\", \"No  awesome. Our courses department is pretty excellent here.\": \"well ROTC is kinda forcing me into  \", \"So uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \" just practice all the time i feel that  \", \"Uh-hmm.\": \"hat will help\", \"Yeah. Yeah  I think so  it's always import to help the problem. Uh  so tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome the problem?\": \"\", \"Ah  yes. \": \"(slight laugh)\", \"Yeah. \": \"So  um  I'd say it took  it took a lot of initiative that I hadn't taken before in pulling that event together. I came to meetings and made sure everyone was on task  made sure \", \"That inevitable. \": \" well and i feel my battalion has set me  \", \"That went well. So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?\": \"l in the future\", \"So  now thinking back to the job that we talked about  now why do you think we should hire you?\": \"\", \"Well  thank you. For coming to your interview today.\": \"I\\u2019m good  \", \"Please tell me about yourself.\": \"being discussed  so  um  yeah I did my best  to really pull the team together as best as I could. \", \"Really?\": \"Uh  we were often working in groups of like two or three. Um  there have been conflicts in those situations where um it's difficult..like if a team member uh messes up something or even uh before that if team members come to the team with different lab experience due to their research background or classes they've taken before. \", \"Excellent. That was  that was a wonderful experience.\": \"Ok\", \"So umm tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Ok  \", \"Hmm. Uhh that's all the license. Umm so I guess we can go over some of the details. Can you tell me a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?\": \"Umm yeah I\\u2019m studying computer science and biology  which is a pretty new umm course here at MIT  and currently I\\u2019m taking mostly biology classes  I\\u2019m also doing research in the hematology lab  and umm  yeah so a little bit about myself umm I guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college  I was born in Tai\\u2026 I was born in California\\u2026 in Irvine  umm and my parents and I moved back to Taiwan when I was about 10  so I went to International school there  umm but yeah  most of my friends were pretty bilingual. They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that I\\u2019m pretty you know fluent at both languages. And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes.\", \"Umm so tell me what are your weaknesses and you're going about to improving them.\": \"A team  umm  lets see  ok so over the summer umm  I actually  this last summer before my junior year  umm  I went to Taiwan and China. Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach\\u2026\", \"Umm so now finally  think of the job you'd like to have. So now why do you think we should hire you?\": \"And this was in groups of three  so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group\\u2026\", \"Well thank you for coming.\": \"And so what this conflict arose  umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we weren\\u2019t sure because there were  there was also another group  another group of three teaching at the same time and we weren\\u2019t sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more  more time with all of the six instructors  umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks\\u2026\", \"[laughs] Uh  so  please tell me about yourself.\": \"Ok. I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh  self confidence. I  you know  I\\u2019m not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything\", \"Uh  excellent. So tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Well I think that  you know  I (laughs) I I\\u2019ve demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field  umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT. \", \"Uh  excellent. Sounds like a fun time. \": \"So that\\u2019s been a very  very large  big part of my life since umm last January. Umm  when I got my EMT  EMS umm license  and yeah so I actually work here at MIT umm as a Emergency Medical Technician  Uhh  I work probably 15 hours a week on that. Umm  but moreso beyond my experience I really have a passion for the medical field. Umm  and I you know want to see help both the research that I do that you know  hopefully  in the future uhh  some clinical  the clinical work that I do will effect medical field.\", \"So  uh  tell me about a time you worked in a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?\": \"Pretty good  how are you?\", \"So  tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them. \": \"All right. Um  I guess  to start with the basics  I'm uh  a junior at MIT right now. I'm studying course six three  it's computer science. And uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year. And um  that's after I transferred here from the University of Michigan. And then uh  since then pretty much everything I do has been computer science. \", \"[laugh] Um  Actually you've done surprisingly good so far. Uh  so now think of a job that you'd like to have. So why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Yeah.\", \"Well thanks for coming today.\": \"'s this kind of flip flopping between interacting with my peers and like  making sure they were on top of their um  you know  their jobs as counselors. Watching the kids and making sure the kids are having fun. Also  like  playing around with the kids and making sure the kids are like  not thinking about anything  but having  but having a good time. So um  this kind of  I just like  should that answer the question?\", \"Oh good.\": \"Um  you know  try to get people to um  like try to get people to go to event  even though  and they weren't assigned. Just out of  like the eagerness to take photos and photography. And so  um  we kind of approached this challenge and motivated  it was like it was sort of a challenge in motivating our  our um  peers. And so  um  or like incentivizing these photos. And  we approached by trying to  like build a sense of community and uh  like  like  and like and ambition in terms of like taking photos. Um  it was  it ended up playing out very well  but there's still a couple photographers who just  you know. \", \"I'm pretty well.\": \"They just didn't want to do the job  sometimes. I mean  they  they usually had like  valid  some what valid excuses  but. \", \"Well  I brought an umbrella so it's not too bad \": \"Yeah  but yeah this job still need to get done. So uh  yeah  I mean  that was uh  pretty interesting team experience. \", \"Yeah. So uhm... Tell me about yourself.\": \"Sure  um  yes. Let's see  um  maybe one of my  I'd say one of my weaknesses is communicating my thoughts clearly. Uh  at times I struggle to uh  I struggle to quickly come up with a sentence or phrase to describe what I'm thinking. And so  I like  I find myself kind of slowly articulating a sentence. And um  there's some situations were  just like that those pauses and that slow thinking or slow articulation is uh  can be problematic. And in other  in other situations  like the slow thinking ends up being some what useful  because I've  you know  I don't say anything  I don't tend to say anything rash. And so  um  it has it's merits. But usually  its just in general  it's nicer just to have a faster pace so  in kind of like conveying thoughts. \", \"Oh cool. I'm from Chicago too.\": \"Um  um  so I'd say that I'm committed  hard working  uh  person. And  in terms of this job I guess  uh  and my edge  can I describe what it is?\", \"Uh  Wilmeka.\": \"All right  so in my head it's a software engineering position and so  I believe as um  I can contribute a lot to this  with the skills that I've gained here at uh  MIT. And  then also  I believe that I can gain a lot from the company  in terms of learning um  about what they do and how they do it. And  I think it would be a good partnership. \", \"Oh cool. So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"So  umm I was wandering  umm I'm actually from Russia. I grew up in Tulun  though  and I normally go to Cambridge University-\", \"Uh huh\": \"-which is  which is where I study. Here I am  uhh a foreign exchange student uhh with MIT. Uhh I study course six umm mainly I focus my interest  split them more like uhh between umm the afternoon where I focus more on devices look like  nano electronics uhh processing methods umm circuits and also stuff that has to do with uhh I think it has to do with AI control machine loading umm so what I'm interested in. I've been taking courses to that uhh goal  so things like 6034  6052  6017  umm in those same areas I've done several projects umm like something Cambridge over summer  I did a I wrote a uhh simulator umm the simulator basically simulates a landing on Mars and has to take in account physics umm graphics  planetary rotation umm and I have to write an AI which accounts for all that and is able to land and launch umm in a space craft. Umm similarly  I've also been participating in a robotics uhh competition in Cambridge. Umm it was similar to MIT's Mass Lab umm and I was on the software team again uhh although I have done a little bit of electronics and the goal of that project was to  in a team of six  create a robot which is able to navigate a black uh sorry a white grid on a black table umm and be able to pick up a cylinder thing with a magnet or without a magnet based on whether uhh it was magnetic or not take it into a certain box  and I programmed the uh AI for that. So that's the most experience I've had. Umm in Cambridge here uhh I've considered participating in uhh umm Battlecode or Mass Lab perhaps. Umm there's been some quite interesting projects going on umm in class; those should be quite interesting. \", \"Hm.\": \"Definitely. Uh  so  right now  I'm working on a  I just actually finished a group project that we were doing. And  we had to design this  uh  speech system. And  we got to a point within our system where we surveyed a large number of people  it was like 630 people that we surveyed  and we realized that what they wanted was not what we'd designed our system for. \", \"*laughs*\": \"-and  umm  so we had this  at the end of the service near to the end  there was a umm a anti air camp where all the anti air regiments and battalions were coming together at this one big training camp and as a member of the communication squad  umm we had to go and set up some things for the light fly exercises and because our sergeant was away doing some things  umm I really didn't know what he was doing  but I-I had to take charge of the squad and make sure that the cables were done right and had to delegate tasks to certain people that  you know  these two guys  you know  do this cable and these guys set up the radio  I'll do this and so yeah it was quite alright I guess that way.\", \"Ah excellent. So tell me about a time you were working on a team. You faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?\": \"Umm well with the with the six people uhh we split each ourselves in three teams  three sub teams. One was mechanical  one was electrical  and one was uhh AI. Now because my programming experience was much bigger than the programming experience of the other guy on my team  umm we said that it'd be better if he was to help out with the mechanics 'cause there was umm a lot of hand work to be done uhh a lot of design work there and the AI is easily written by me  when umm I just kind of have a clear idea it was much faster then splitting with other people  it was rather simple AI I guess. Umm now  with the mechanics it's much more important they get all this stuff done  leave some time in the workshop work so it was a decision we had to make umm to get more of that kind of get more of that hand work to the mechanical team  more man power to the mechanical team. Uhh with the electrical team umm we decided that we wanted the meaning doing most of the design work for the electronics 'cause you get a better idea and they also gonna be doing most of the soldering of electronic parts 'cause so we got uhh some basic components we we got this controller block umm with with a CPU inside but it had to be wired to sensors and controllers and other controllers and all that so we had to do all those circuits. Umm so one of the guys  Oscar  umm was much more into that so he took charge into design and uhh Calvin did much more the soldering and stuff. I kind of helped out when they needed some help. Umm so yeah we just needed to have a clear delegation of tasks and just do a bit of try if somebody needs something done we'd be able to produce a kind of working-ish result-\", \"Uh huh.\": \"Um as a junior. And then I'll probably do math or something else. But it that just kind of shows you that I'm willing to learn.\", \"Ah excellent. So  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Umm I guess one of my weaknesses is that I often get carried away umm I guess somewhat arrogantly. Umm when I'm working with something  and I think I have a really good idea of what I am doing  umm something is better than other umm I have a better idea of wondering than therefore try to tell them maybe they're doing it slightly wrong be sort of somewhat more self-absorbed in what resources need to be allocated because I'm doing a lot of stuff and they might be doing it more slowly so I can use this for longer or something. Umm not not to the point of insulting people but more sort of center of attention kind thing  I guess. Umm I'm trying to kind of be more mindful of what other people are doing and sometimes that even though I think I have an idea of what I'm doing  I don't actually or that I might be mistaken. So I kind of try to be more kind of chilled and laid back just yeah so yeah  but it's a work in progress.\", \"Hm  oh that makes a lot of sense. So  I'd like you to think of a job that you'd like to have.\": \"Yeah  pretty good. Um  don't feel particularly different from any other day.\", \"Got it?\": \"Um  so I'm from Nearbell Fosten [SP]  Northern Ireland. I have three younger brothers  um  so  I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them. Like  Mark  the next one down  he's only a year younger than me  so he was always a lot sportier. Uh  coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that  I got into those sports. Um  and then Ian  the next one down after him  is a lot more artsy and stuff  so I think because of his influence I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of  like  disregarded before. Um  Like  um  when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like  um  the Scream by Munch or Moonch . . .\", \"Okay  so  why do you think we should hire you for this job?\": \"I think yeah  I uhh  yeah  I am a team player  umm  within reason of course. As long as I don't think some ridiculous demand is being made of me. Which is demeaning or it's just  not useful in terms of  it  if there's a demand being made of me that's not fulfilled by me and my skill set  then I will  you know  defer to someone else on the team. But  given that it is a demand or a request that's made that will tailor itself to my skill set  I  I think that I'm a team player. Umm  you know  for example  I'm more skilled at quantitative analysis than people from maybe other backgrounds  and there have been many times  you know  working on group projects and interdisciplinary crafts   where I would be asked to take on some extra role  for data analysis  just simply because I have more experience in the field. And  it would be  just more beneficial to the entire to team to have someone who already has more experience. To not have to enter the learning curve at the steepest point  umm  but instead to be able to produce  you know  good work pretty quickly.\", \"Ah  well  thank you for coming.\": \"Uh  so  this  I'm here on my third year  what you call junior year  my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college. So as part of that we do have like  we call it Thrashers Week  where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush  dorm exploration or whatever  um  so we had a big kind of end to that week  finale event that kind of took over college  like  multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18  so everyone at university could drink  so there were different promotions on different  um  bars all over the place in the college  different attractions and stuff. So  um  just kind of planning that  deciding what the theme would be  um  how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that  and getting music acts  um  getting promotions on the main bar  and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters  fire extinguisher points  emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections  particularly  [??] being responsible for a particular area  I think that's quite a practical hands-on  time when I've been given leadership and I think I done well with it. \", \"Oh  ok.\": \" Um  I think I would be a really good addition to a linguistics research team  because I'm really really passionate about linguistics and it's something I really enjoy spending lots of time working on.  Um  and I enjoy working on a team and I work well with other people.  And I've had research positions in the past and I think I would umm be a good addition to a team.\", \"Ok  please tell me about yourself.\": \"Um  I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job  but  like  almost any job  um  in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector. It's going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that  like  I've used my university time so far in the UK and in America  really broadening the experience that I've got. Uh  broadening my  uh  ex- exposure to different fields of engineering.\", \"Oh  yeah?\": \"And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even  like  artsy stuff. Um  I also think that through like projects  lab work  and things of that nature  I have the skills to work in a team. Be that  having the  uh  kind of humility to accept  okay  there's someone more experiences  more knowledgeable than me in this  I'll take the lead from them or I'll start realizing when it's an appropriate time I'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to  or I'm the best qualified to really take command.  \", \"So  um  back to leadership. Tell me a time when you acted as a leader. \": \"So  like  in terms of working with others  that's a strength that I have  um  and I think in terms of contributing to like  the overall atmosphere in the company  I'm quite a pleasant  optimistic person. I like to think that I'm someone that others would be happy to work around  so not only would I be working well  but others would be working well  um  through my being there. Um  I'm not saying like I'm going to suddenly make the company  like  200% more profitable  but I do think that I'll feedback in as much benefit as I'll get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy.\", \"That\\u2019s an excellent example of leadership. So  this is a similar question  but related. Tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. Not this time  a different one. \": \"OK. Thank you.\", \"Faced a challenge  how did you solve it?\": \"I'm doing pretty good\", \"\": \"How about you?\", \"That makes a lot of sense. So  tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you\\u2019ve done to overcome them. \": \"Yeah  it's kinda shitty outside haha.\", \"That makes a lot of sense. So  think about a job you would like to have. Do you have one in mind?\": \"Gotcha. Yeah I thought it was going to snow but I'll take like drizzle over that.\", \"So  tell me why do you think you should have this job?\": \"Uhm.. So I'm a junior obviously here at MIT. I'm studying chemical  biological engineering and minoring in economics. Uhm  I live in Cap Sigma which is one of the fraternities on campus. I'm from Chicago. Uhm  actually I was just home recently for Thanksgiving. Uhm  and then  here on campus I obviously go to class and when I'm not in class I do the like getting involved in my fraternity as well as  uhm  I try to help with Habitat for Humanity so I do a lot with them and some community service stuff that we have as well.\", \"I think your personality matches that. Well  this concludes the formal part of the interview.\": \"Oh cool. Where?\", \"So can you tell me about a time when you acted as a leader.\": \"\", \"Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge.  So  perhaps  the challenge you're talking about.  How did you go about resolving it?\": \"Uhm  so  if I had to give I guess an example of leadership..uhm.. recently this semester I'd probably talk about uhm working with Habitat for Humanity like I mentioned before  uhm  I'm currently the president of the club and uhm so we do a couple of different things on campus here  both on and off campus  uhm  related to like international organization and so one of the big things we do on campus is we  uhm  have what we call the Beaverdash. And its a 5k run around the West end of campus.\", \"Interesting.  So  can you tell me about one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to sort of improve on that.\": \"\", \"Well cool.  A lot of fun courses here.  So then I'd like you to think of a job you'd like to have.\": \"\", \"Do you have one in mind?\": \"So.\", \" Good  okay.  So now  why do you think you should have this job?\": \"\", \"Ah.\": \"\", \"So hi  I'm Dr. Powell.\": \"We were working with the President's office. Uh combining with President Griphes inauguration night. Actually they contacted me\", \"I'm well  thank you.  So  uh  please tell me about yourself.\": \"\", \"Tell me about a time when you were working in a team and you faced a challenge.  How did you solve the problem.\": \"And resources that I normally wouldn't have. So I uh was able to work with that. but I think it was a very interesting leadership posi- uh  position because I was networking with my own execs which is 10 of my own students that I work with. As well as the greater club which is about 100 kids that actively participate. But then also in conjunction with the President's office which is a couple people in uh staff  uhm. With like  uh  the Z center and things like that. So we were all working together to organize this larger than normal event in conjunction with other activities going on that weekend. So it definitely took like going to meetings with like staff and more important people in the world of MIT. And like relaying messages and working with like my own board and getting stuff done. And selling tickets and actually running the event and coordinating the volunteers and things like that. So I think it was a really good leadership opportunity and I worked with a lot of interesting people.\", \"Tell me one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.  \": \"Uhm  lets think of a good challenge. Uhm.. Okay so  uhm  more recently  I was working on well I'm involved with my fraternity. One of my objectives was to plan a little retreated that we have  like going camping.\", \"And now  why do you think we should hire you?\": \"So as part of that I work with a team of people  some of them are freshmen which is who the retreat is meant for. Some of the are my friend  well everyone's my friend  but so its like an interesting dynamic because you're working with your friends but you have to kinda be managing them and stuff like that. So that was like challenge number one. But then the real challenge was to coordinate essentially like we had 60 people and we wanted to go camping somewhere. The real challenge we had was getting people to commit and to count accurate numbers and stuff like that. So I was really able to like in the context of the team organize people to go and personally talk to like all 60 people. So we could get a feel for like who was actually coming. Because an issue we had in the past 50 people would say they wanted to come but only 40 people would show up. Those 10 people are actually like hundreds of dollars wasting. and so its really important to get an accurate count and finding out who has dietary restrictions who had certain. Traditionally it is really nice to use like email to talk to people but here we've been really utilizing  uhm  actually going in person and having meetings together and breaking out and talking to individuals  and then  like  doing allocation of like  who  was going to call the various utilities whether it be car rental or food purchase or stuff like that. Uhm so there's a lot of different allocation of  uh  tasks  and then  like individual talking to people and so those kinda overcame those different challenges.\", \"Well thank you for coming.  \": \"\", \"Okay  tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"\", \"And why do you think you should get into graduate school?\": \"Uhhhmmm  sure.\", \"You're busy.\": \"I\\u2019m actually doing pretty well. I\\u2019m just  uh  I would say  well  let\\u2019s see. It\\u2019s the end of the semester  right after Thanksgiving break. So  I have a bunch of time to relax and that sort of thing. This is the first time I didn\\u2019t get home though.\", \"Uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um  so I spent a bunch of time actually with my friends from my fraternity. And  we had Thanksgiving dinner together. The turkey  the whole shebang. Um  most people around this time have all sort of exams  that sort of thing. But  all things considered compared to like freshman  sophomore  junior year  um I\\u2019m actually taking an extra semester to technically still a junior.\", \"M'hmm.\": \"It\\u2019s just one of the new fraternities that just you know came out of nowhere. We were back on campus awhile ago  but that\\u2019s history  um. I\\u2019m a late grower  and I\\u2019m also a chemical engineer. Most people have to say Course 10 for their major that sort of thing  uh. And  I\\u2019m part of the growing engineer leadership program. So  uh  all things considered  I would say that the the things that I\\u2019ve come to learn the most since coming to MIT are leadership skills  being confident  being able to go in front of people  and  uh  sort of create a vision. Helping people follow that vision. I have had issues in the past of time management. But  I spent a long time doing  like freshman  sophomore year learning the importance of sleep. Bunch of things like that. I\\u2019ve gone through the whole  all the trials and tribulations. But  all things considered  I\\u2019d say pretty much right now  I\\u2019m smooth  like in a groove  doing my own kind of thing. Things that I want to do. And  having a good time. \", \"Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Well  to start  um  I guess to start. The three things I\\u2019m doing right now: I\\u2019m president of my fraternity  SAE  which I also helped start up.\", \"Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?\": \"Course 10. Chemical engineering. ICE. You are given a challenge in a team. Most people  you can actually choose your team. Most people throughout there are  there fun people  good at working with (inaudible) that sort of thing. Uh  but by the time I went to choose my team most of my friends had been swooped up. So  I was working with kind of a random group of people. Which kind of worked out. It turned out pretty well. The project itself. You have to design a chemical engineering plant. So  you have to do the reactors  you have to do the flow  the mass flow  the distribution com center  etc. And then there\\u2019s a big report. There\\u2019s all sorts of stuff. In general breakdown  there\\u2019s one person who sort of becomes like the expert for the program  the Aspen program. And  then there\\u2019s another person whose more like working on the actual write up  and then there\\u2019s another person that sort of integrates the two. What  what as the question? Working in a team?\", \"Why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Ok  um  I guess the biggest issue that came up in that project was the deadline. Two and three days before the actual deadline  the final project was due  the main issue came up  the kiln wasn\\u2019t working  the project wasn\\u2019t working. So  it\\u2019s a pretty typical MIT scenario. The main thing that was the issue was that the guy that was responsible for doing the coding was a really silent guy. So  he was like the silent coder that was off doing his own work  when you\\u2019re trying to integrate it into the rest of the project  um  we should have collaborating a lot  but this other guy was sort of off in his own world. So  when we needed his part of the project  it was sort of difficult to do. So  what we had to do was we had to sit down all three of us together and go play by play with this guy to sort of get the medium that they left. To  sort of get the project together. Um  and I would say the hardest part was just interacting with this man because he was very quiet. He did get a lot of quality work done  but looking back  what I would have tried to do better was noticed he was a quieter person  and really tried to get him to be more  uh  evocative. You know  sharing the thoughts and stuff that he was doing during like the feed. The project we ended up delivering on time up to spec  but it would have been better if we had started with the issue at the beginning.\", \"Good! Tell me about yourself.\": \"Yeah  I\\u2019ve been thinking about that for awhile.\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. \": \"Yea.  I'm kind of a perfectionist and I like everything to work out well.  Which means that when I'm starting something new sometimes I can't look over the little details that I don't see that will work.   And I don't get how you can just look past that to see a bigger picture and come with a big idea and then work on the small details later and kind of more detail oriented and then work for the bigger goal.  So that's definitely been one of my problems and I have been working on getting over that.  But just thinking about it in the future and just you know you can get there and you look at the bigger goal and then if you divvy it up into smaller tasks its a lot easier to overcome and deal with everything so.\", \"Uh-huh.\": \"Um  Good. \", \"'kay  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Uh  uh  uh  I guess for my another class Im taking this semester which is Design and Manufacturing there's a group of eight people and we're tasked with designing and manufacturing a hundred helios (sp)  um  yeah  and so  I guess the  the  the prerequisite to the class was  uh  Design and Manufacturing 1 where we had to make one robot.  And sort of  that was more individual  but here we're tasked with the  the big thing here is manufacturing and so I  it's easy for everyone to want to decide to design this helio but you have to consider the manufacturing aspect  like how easy would it be to make if you're making a ton of them.  And so this was a challenge getting everyone to agree on sort of one design idea and I sort of  I brought up  I made it  I made sure to let everyone know it wasn't just the design that we're worrying about  it's also  and more so  the manufacturing aspects.\", \"Great  and why do you think we should hire you?\": \"Uh  so I'm not  I say I like public speaking but I'm not very good at it.  I say that's one of my greatest weaknesses  um  and sort of working on it hasn't been hard just because it's something I like doing.  Um  and so  like  given opportunities I try to be the leader of a certain group.  That way I talk to  I'm talking to the whole group a lot.  That sort of helps my speaking.  And just like in class projects  particularly humanities  I try to focus on taking ones where there's public speaking involved  not just writing essays.\", \"Here you go. How are you doing today?\": \"Yeah  sure.\", \"Good  tell me about yourself.\": \"Uh  because I am as I'm a junior at MIT and um  this is a good place to find sort of the best engineers  some of the best engineers in the world and student  sort of  interns and I'd do  I'd do a great job interning at this company sort of because of the experience I have previously and the knowledge  combine that with the knowledge I'm getting here at a world class institute.  I think that'd make me well-qualified.\", \"Mmhmmm.\": \"Hi  I'm Jacob.  Pleased to meet you.\", \"Mmmhmmm\": \"Good.  How are you?\", \"Computer Science and Math.\": \"I'm a junior at MIT studying math and science and Im looking for a summer internship at your company this summer.\", \"OK.  So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"So  I'm actually currently president of two student groups on campus.  The Educational studies program  which runs uh  large scale educational programs for middle and high school students where they take classes taught by MIT students.  And the MIT Mystery Hunt   which is a one weekend event in January with thousands of MIT students and other community members come to participate in a large multi-day sort of puzzle competition.  I'd be happy to go into detail about either of those but I have plenty of stories to tell\", \"mmmmmmm\": \"Okay.  So one thing that comes to mind is a couple months ago I was in a robotics competition at MIT called Mass Lab.  So  it's an autonomous robotics competition where you have to design  build  program the robot from scratch.  And I was in charge of programming the robot for the team.  We ran into several problems with the vision libraries we were trying to use in order to try to track the balls and field elements  just weren't working for us.  We spent probably the first half of the month trying to get these to work for the team and  um  eventually just decided that it would be easier for us to start from scratch and  uh  write everything ourselves.  Sort of by  you know  throwing out the assumption that we should work with the code we were given and starting from (?) principles we were able to actually  um  get our vision to \", \"oh\": \"l above most of the other teams because we could sort of custom write the code to be specific to the task at hand rather than trying to adapt general libraries.\", \"OK.  So tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \" Okay.  Um  I guess one of the weaknesses I've found is that I tend not to know when to ask for help.  So  for instance at my internship last summer this is something that my mentor pointed out to me several times.  If I got stuck on a problem I would just see what I could do about it  you know  Google around for the solution  see if anyone else had encountered the problem and then only after a couple of days of trying to work around it then talk to someone.  Whereas  you know  if I just asked someone for help the first day they could say  Oh  I ran into this problem last month.  This is how you fix it and avoid me sort of this hassle of trying to Google and figure it out on my own.  So  I um  I definitely started to become more aware of this over the summer and made a conscious effort to  when I was having a problem  you know  look at my watch and figure out how much time I was wasting trying to solve it.  If it got to me more than half an hour on my own I would just poke someone next to me and ask them.  I think just sort of continuing that and trying to make sure that I'm keeping up the habit of ensuring that I'm not getting stuck on my own should help.\", \"Good.   And can you tell me a weakness?   One of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it.\": \"Any other questions?\", \"Good.  Baby steps.   And why do you think we should hire you?\": \"I'm good  how about you?\", \"Mmmmhmmm.\": \"Uh  so I'm a junior majoring in biology at MIT. Um  I'm interested in approaching graduate school in biological oceanography. Um  I'm also doing a minor in chemistry. I currently work in the Thompson Lab here at MIT.\", \"Okay.  Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um  I would say  so uh I'm the vice president of Campus Outreach here at MIT's teenage beauty. Um  yeah so we're in charge of generally reaching out to the student population here at MIT. Um  so what I've done is basically try and form partnerships with maybe clinics in the Boston area  like Fenway Health and try to get them to maybe set up screenings here at MIT. \", \"And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve it?\": \"Um  I would say probably in my previous lab  this past summer I worked in Israel and we were having a lot of trouble with just  um  figuring out a protocol for how to um culture the bacteria that we were trying to do. So  it was generally  just like getting input from everybody and um trying not to get heated because we were kind of like  pressed for results. \", \"And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.\": \"Uh  I would say one weakness is probably that I don't  um  speak up very much  or I would prefer not to speak up maybe  so that probably maybe leaves opportunities or maybe give less input than I would in certain situations. So um  what I'm doing to overcome that is probably more of  maybe not concrete things really  but hopefully just trying to get more experience so that I can maybe feel more confident about myself. \", \"Okay.  And why do you think we should hire you.\": \"I think because I really have a passion for this field. I cannot imagine myself doing anything other than research. It is definitely what I want to do for the rest of my life and I think I would be a good candidate for academia.\", \"Good. Tell me about yourself. \": \"I'm sorry?\", \"Mm-hmm. \": \"And it was very down to the wire which we weren't aware of.  I mean planning an event around winter break is never really easy schedule wise and stuff.  But it was definitely a challenge for us  but it was  it ended up being successful and we raised over $4000 for us.\", \"Mm. Mm-hmm.\": \"I thought that was one of the most important  um  factors in our success. We ended up doing pretty well as a group.\", \"Great. And tell me a time about when you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"Um  let's see  uh  so I did a  um  RA  I was an RA in my dorm  and we were in charge of leading the group of freshman  um  in advising them for academic reasons and  also in doing that- organizing events around the dorm  so I would occasionally be in the  uh  in the leadership position for that.\", \"Right.\": \"I would probably try to make myself less self conscious.\", \"Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"I'm Amanda  I'm a freshman at MIT. So.\", \"Ready?\": \"What I would change is to  uh  I guess  uh  just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I  than a person at my level would  you know  at this kind of level  and that's umm  that's something that would be nice. You know I feel like I would be able to be uh  much further along in my career than I am now.\", \"Good. I'm doing well  as well. Please tell me about yourself.\": \"And I have noticed that a tend to be a person who when the slack doesn't  you know the slack starts to happen  is kind of do it  and after a while it gets very taxing to pick up for everyone and so I remember senior year we just had this project  um  in Math.  And it was just so frustrating to do it by myself  and so I set every one and I was like I can't do this on my own anymore  and I really need your help.  And it was really nice because they were my friends  and they didn't realize they were doing it.  And so we like made up a new plan and re divied the work and it worked out in the end.\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? \": \"I think you should hire me because I have had a lot of experience dealing with other people and communicating and making sure that coming up  like to come up with the best solution that everyone can hopefully agree with. And you know of course not everyone can get their way but it's important to try and get everyone's ideas into one if you can so.\", \"Mmm.. okay. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it. \": \" Okay  I'm a computer science major  um  I'm a  senior at MIT and I'm hoping to stay in the area next year.  I'm looking for a job here.  And I grew up in South Dakota and little bit in Cambodia  grew up on a farm.  I really enjoy playing music and cooking.  Probably my two biggest hobbies.\", \"Great. And why should we hire you?\": \" Well  when I was in high school I was the leader of my 4-H club and that involved leading meetings.  There were a lot of younger kids were involved and I helped them get involved in sewing competitions for example and  um  things where they could learn about nutrition.  Um  and showing their animals and learning about how to raise an animal well.  So that was a big leadership role and it was kind of difficult but I definitely learned a lot from it.\", \"Um  tell me about yourself.\": \"d like to play and how we'd like to practice and the styles of music that we'd like to play  um  and to do that properly you just need to communicate a lot  um  and you need to be willing to sometimes do the things that you really don't want to do.\", \"Just Anything.\": \" I think that I am a strong  strong learner  definitely at whatever new skills since in web development there's always new technologies coming along.  I am quick at learning those and I really enjoy learning new things.  And I have a good base with my computer science degree from MIT so I know in general how to think about programming.\", \"Great...so tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Well  I'm Zainab Lasisi\", \"OK...Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?\": \"I'm a junior majoring in chemical engineering. I was originally born in Nigeria. Which is in West Africa. \", \"Mmhumm.\": \"And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT. \", \"OK can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what your doing to overcome it?\": \"So as the vice president I have to be bas-  I have to basically support the president. And whenever the president of the association is not there step in. And actually be the leader for the association. \", \"Its fine.\": \"So the African Student's Association is about an organization of  uhh  that consists of. That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT. And  it's just all undergraduates. And it's all about just keep the African community alive. \", \"Mmmhmmm.\": \"And just  so that people know that they have a support system. \", \"Mmhmm.  And why should we hire you?\": \"Within  uh  MIT. \", \"So how are you doing today ?\": \"...for them. Yeah.\", \"Good . Tell me about yourself .\": \"I'd probably say my past internship with BP. \", \"Mm\": \"Um  I was working on a team. I was a process engineer intern. And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that  they didn't really know what. They hadn't  the project hadn't been done before. It's just something  like  they had ideas about what they wanted. \", \"Mm-hmm\": \"So  I'm not great with administrative work. \", \"Mm-hmm \": \"...or anything. We just knew the  I guess  the skill set. And the types of things they want from my project. So for me  just to go about delivering a  a tool that's of use to the entire team. It is about working with people  communicating  asking them questions...\", \"Mm. \": \"Um  so I  my background is in mechanical engineering. What I really enjoy doing though  um is  leadership type rolls. So I like talking with people but I also like doing technical problems. So I'm looking for a position that really combines those two things. Uh where I can use my communications skills with people as well as my technical background in a roll that's kinda combin.. involves decision making  uh and different business factors. \", \"Uh.\": \"Hmm m...a time when I was working with a team...I guess if I could count my acapella group as a team. cause I guess it is.\", \"Right. Right. Right.\": \"I'm good \", \"Right. Right. right.\": \"Um I'm from Mumbai . I'm a junior in core six . When I applied to ITU I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do \", \"Right. Right. Right. OK. Can tell what your weakness is and what you're doing to overcome it?\": \"Um sure . So well this is the most recent example\", \"Any weakness.\": \"I can think of . But I um was a freshman . I was I mean I still am pretty excited about international developments\", \"You didn't learn?\": \"So I joined um um as it was it was it was . It wasn't formally ? in the USA but we decided to take it on . . .\", \"Right. Right. Right. Right.\": \". . . it's not . So um that was a great thing for me to get involved with . And um that summer I went and traveled with them to Kenya\", \"I'm well  thank you.So  please tell me about yourself.\": \"There was someone who was just starting. She wa- she was a freshman that year. Um but she was great.\", \" Mhmm. Tell me how you demonstrate leadership.\": \"And uh we decided to make this app with um when you have two iPhones uh you can swipe like you can bump them and uh whatever's on one phone the other one.\", \"So please tell me about a time when you were working in a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve the problem?\": \"could split them. It was something that you know we we hadn't done before. Not a ton of people have done it.\", \"Tell me about one of your weaknesses and uh how you plan to overcome it.\": \"And um at the media lab there was this technology that of I don't know discovered ?? um called Swipe. And they just swipe from one to the other and we we thought that would be great. And it someone like a student like us who had done it.\", \"Thank you for coming.\": \"And you know we have all these bugs and stuff. And we have no documentation to go to. But there was this one person on the team you know being you know the awesome programmer he is insisted on going that way when . . .\", \"Good. Tell about yourself?\": \"Which was kind of standard . . .\", \"Great. So tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Because he . . .\", \"Mmm.\": \"Ok. I'm a junior at MIT majoring in electrical engineering computer science as well as mathematics. Um and I have a couple of previous internships under my belt as you can see on my resume  so I feel like I come prepared with a lot of experience both from school and outside.\", \"Mmm  okay. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge? How did you solve that problem?\": \"Is this a technical weakness or . . .\", \"Right  right  right.\": \"That I haven't quite learned um is that whenever you're you know whenever you're in doubt you should just go ahead and do stuff.\", \"Oh goodness.\": \"But uh in general I like if you just just get my hands dirty and then do stuff. Yeah.\", \"Alright.\": \"And I'm not afraid of trying new stuff. And with this technology will always change. And sure if I don't PHP today right now you can use it tomorrow.\", \"Mmmm.\": \"\\tUm  that\\u2019s not a question I\\u2019ve been asked a lot. I think there are a few things. Um  one that comes to mind immediately is my written communication skills. Um  I definitely know that\\u2019s something that I need to work on and  um  would love the opportunity to improve on that.\", \"Alright. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're trying to overcome it?\": \"Uh  so I'm an undergraduate uh in the third year  at uh  here at MIT and I'm studying computer science. Um  I am really interested in um applying for a software job.Um  I want to get more experience in web development and software development and also get some exposure into data science and machine learning. And uh see how that plays out in uh the industry setting uh since I've done some research\", \"Mmm  okay. And why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"Uhm  leadership? So currently I'm on uh the South Asian American Students Exec Board. So  that's uh basically uh the Indian Cultural club uh for undergrads. And uh I'm secretary and community service chair. Um So I'm currently organizing um reaching out to groups in the Boston area um and uh groups that work overseas in India with um for charity and community service opportunities that I can connect to uh undergrads here.Um And uh I'm also involved in other activities that SAS  the group  uh is involved in like setting up and planning like uh study breaks. Our recent uh garba  which is an Indian dance festival. And also in I'm in Phi Kappa Theta fraternity and uh I've held leadership positions there  uh  in my freshman year in our pledge class when I was the community service chair for that  as well. Uh and  led my class of uh 15 in um going out into the community and we went down into different places in Boston and helped clean up streets  etc. \", \"So tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"I think you should hire me because I have a lot of ideas I'm really good at coming up with ideas between table  especially in terms of um software development. I um projects for school and one or two of my own independent projects I've been working on by myself and with friends. I've uh  been good at optimization  um of software and coming up with good ideas um on the user end. So  uh  I'm able to look at a project from different stand points and think about what all parties would want. What-what would be easiest for the development team as well as the end users.\", \"So tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve that problem?\": \"Thank you.\", \"Great.  So  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you\\u2019re doing to overcome it.\": \"Mhmm.\", \"Great.  And why do you think you should go to law school?\": \"Awesome. How about yourself?\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem.\": \"Well in high school I was captain of golf team. And that was a blast.  Golf  girl\\u2019s golf is not super competitive...\", \"Mmhm. Great. And can you tell me one of your weakness and what you are doing to overcome it.\": \"to say the least. It's very...haphazard and it's usually been one extreme or another. Very bimodal. Um  you've either got these like super serious girls  who are parents on the course with them and they're going to be all PGA.\", \"Mmhm.\": \"Or you just girls that are not that athletic just goofing off with golf clubs...\", \"Great. And why do you think you should get into graduate school?\": \"and doing whatever. And Berkeley High is definitely the ladder of that.\", \"Good. \": \"We played a lot of games--we had really a great time.\", \"Pretty Good.\": \"But a big part of it is like... you know there was like a leadership aspect? We had to like stay organized. Especially because no one else was.\", \"Tell me about yourself? Alright\": \"And  so like making sure we made it to meets and like...organizing snacks  making sure people showed up.\", \"Mhmm \": \"Well  I mean I can continue the same example because I didn't start off as captain.\", \"Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership? \": \"And it's different  you know? When you\\u2019re the head versus like part of the group. Um  it's more important when you're a part of the group to be a cohesive part and not like the leader.\", \"Sure. \": \"and like polos. It was so funny. You can only imagine how we looked.\", \"Right. \": \"I'm doing well  how are you?\", \"Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team a faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem? \": \"And I feel like I could really make the most impact that way I can utilize...utilize my skills the best way possible.\", \"Of course. \": \"Well  um  last semester I was  ah  a part of the Mentor Core for a student organization on one of MIT\\u2019s campus called Amphibious Achievement.  One of the things  as part of the Mentor Core you have a small group of students that you one on one tutor as their mentor and tutor and you meet with them once a week for a five hour study session and they\\u2019re inner city High School students who - they don\\u2019t have access to the best basic math and reading skills.  So we meet once a week to go over what we\\u2019re going to teach them and we teach them the next day  on a Sunday.  Uhm  and so that\\u2019s leadership in itself  but I took the initiative to plan a sponsorship banquet to thank our very generous donors and so me and another member of the Mentor Core planned  uh  a sponsorship banquet that I was told went very well.  So  I\\u2019m very proud of that.\", \"That's great.  \": \"Well  I guess the one thing that I\\u2019ve learned  uhm  working on several teams throughout my life is  uh  that communication is necessary  um  so  uh  in High School I worked on a team and we had received a grant in order to build an alternative energy  um  device.  Um  and there was a lot of issues amongst the different committees  like so there was an electrical component and there were people trying to build the flotation aspect of it because it was - it was supposed to be in water and there was the water proofing committee.  And so  in terms of communicating deadlines and expectations I think there was a  sometimes there could be a breakdown in that because everyone\\u2019s busy.  And you see that here and I saw that a lot back in High School.  Um  and so I was kind of moderating everyone  um and so just being able to communicate the expectations  um  to make it really apparent  \\u2018cause I think we running a lot of high achieving people a lot of the time  so as long as they know what they need to do and what\\u2019s expected of them  I think  um  at least for me as a high achieving person  I - once I know what I need to do I can do it.  And as long as that\\u2019s communicated and clear I think that\\u2019s necessary to resolve a lot of problems.\", \"Alright. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to over come it? \": \"I\\u2019d say one of my weaknesses can definitely be in terms of organization.  So if there\\u2019s something I know that I need to do  um  I will definitely get it done  but in terms of parsing out the appropriate amount of time sufficiently before hand  sometimes that can be lacking to where there can be times I\\u2019m scrambling at the last second.  I always get it done  but it\\u2019s just in terms of personal stress and maybe stress of people who want to see results over time versus at the end  um  but I have  I\\u2019ve gotten a lot better at that  especially at MIT  because you really can\\u2019t mess around with that kind of  uh  weakness.  Just with  knowing my schedule the month before versus the week before hand.  And investing in a planner and a calendar has definitely helped me a lot.\", \"Good. And  why do you think we should hire you? \": \"Umm  I'm good  I'm good.\", \"So please tell me about yourself\": \"Ok. Umm  well  this past summer I was in China. And  umm  I was helping out with this cognitive learning program. And what they do  is they try take principles  umm  learned through research  and apply those in the classroom. And so-\", \"Excellent. Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"- we were applying those  umm  to students who were in sixth grade  trying to teach them English. And  it was  it was great. So  I got to actually  like  umm  go there and teach a class of sixth graders for the whole summer. So  umm  and they let me develop some of their curriculum  which was very cool. And  umm and it was a great experience overall.\", \"It\\u2019s a very smart idea. I like it. So tell me a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you go about resolving it?\": \"Ok. Umm  well  actually  a part of the same program  uh  we were trying to put up videos of the teaching to give  umm  examples for other people. And  uh  none of us knew how to program or anything like that  and we were  we were in China  so it was  umm  both a language barrier and also  you know like  overcoming that  like  knowledge gap of not knowing how to program. So  what we ended up doing was  like  trying to find a Chinese student who was studying computer science  and  umm  in Beijing  and  the language thing did come in to play  but  umm  but eventually  we were able to  like  sort of  get through that. It was a challenge all the way through.\", \"Yes  that\\u2019s always the best approach. So unh tell me about one of your weakness and how you plan to overcome it.\": \"Yea  umm  so  I have trouble public spe-  like  getting up in front of people and talking.-\", \"Ah yes  that\\u2019s always a good strategy. So now I\\u2019d like you to think of a job that you\\u2019d like to have. Do you have one in mind?\": \"Umm  which is part of why I came in to this interview. Umm  but also this semester  I joined the debate team. Umm  which has been great  so far. Umm  basically  we go around to different colleges for tournaments and  umm  we get up and we just speak for  for an hour. And  umm  and that's  that's really helped out so far.\", \"Okay that wasn\\u2019t the question. I want you to picture one that you\\u2019d like to have.\": \"Umm  because  I  I want to make a difference in this field. Umm I'm very  very committed to this [??]  I mean  I know this is what I want to do. I mean  there's really nothing else I can see myself in the future doing. I mean  I love it  I'm fully committed  and  umm  I'd  I'd like to make a difference here.\", \"For an interview situation. Now tell me why you should have this job.\": \"I'm well thank you. \", \"Why should we hire you?\": \"\", \"Excellent well thanks for coming in with us today.\": \"How about yourself? \", \"That's good for you! That's good  that's good.\": \" And I'm hoping to  ah  to kind of try out what it's like to engineer  um   combine the two basically  mechanical and materials engineering. \", \"Uh  excellent. Robot building is always a fun pastime. \": \"Ok  um  I could give you an example of a club I'm in?\", \"So  can you tell me about a time where you demonstrated leadership?\": \"Um  in  at MIT I'm in Amnesty International  which is a student human rights organization-\", \"Anyway. \": \"at any given time  so it takes a lot of initiative to-\", \"Ah  that make's sense. So uh  tell me a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?\": \"\", \"Yes. So  can you tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you've done to try and overcome it?\": \"really hold the club together  and  uh  we were trying to pull together a big event last semester which involved Professor N-\", \"And  now think of a job you'd like to have.\": \"and we had to talk about Arab spring and we were hosting it in a huge lecture hall  um  so big venue  hoping  expecting a lot of people.\", \"You have one in mind? \": \"Um  but it took a lot of work-\", \"So why should we hire you? \": \"And none of us had really pulled such a huge event before-\", \"I appreciate you coming today.\": \"\", \"Good so tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.\": \"Um  I didn't have an official leadership role-\", \"So uh tell a time when you were working in a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?\": \"So  my participation was ambiguously defined  but  um  it was fun having  uh  having a role.\", \"Thank you. Can you tell me about one of your weaknesses and what you\\u2019re doing to overcome it?\": \"Um  that's a good question. Um  so I was on the orientation group  I was an orientation leader this- \", \"Okay thank you that was important. So now think about a job that you\\u2019d like to have. Okay do you have one in mind?\": \"this  the beginning of this year  and so  we paired off into different groups  uh  we were the brown team  and we had a few problems with getting energy with the team  and  uh  all of these freshman we knew that they were excited to be there- \", \"Good okay  so now why do you think you should have this job?\": \"We knew that they wanted to get to know each other and MIT  but there was just  there was something blocking them from talking and from getting out of orientation what they should have  so  we  uh  we pulled together as a bit of a brown group team  we had a group discussion  after I think it was the second day  and  we took this  um  we took a few tries to pull together some new ice breakers that hadn't been in the booklet that they prepared us for  and just  uh  whipped that out the next day  started yelling  got the kids off their feet and jumping  and um  my  one of my other co-orientation leaders and I were yelling different questions at them and they had to pair up or group up based on the question that we asked them  and   it didn't really work necessarily  um  everybody participated though and it got them  got the blood moving  and it go them kind of talking to new people  so even though the game didn't have a point  it ended up being kind of fun  it was a good  good way of getting to know my teammates a well. \", \"So please tell me about your background.\": \"If I was given one option to change one thing about myself  Uh  I think it would be my hesitation. Uhm  Im pretty hesitant uhm about you know uhm  first ideas or initial thoughts that I have. Uhm I like always have to seek like a second opinion.\", \"I\\u2019m more interested in how long you can talk as long as you like.  For instance if you turn these around 180 that\\u2019s one of the reasons giving you a funny look.  Do you think you\\u2019re a leader?  Tell me why.\": \"Um  because I've researched into your country  sorry into your company  and  um  I think  uh  I think it's  I see a lot of  I see a lot it in the experience that I've had  in  I've had international experience in companies of a scales similar to yours  although  it was in the research department  um  and  I think I cold bring that  coo-  that  um  international perspective  I've lived in several countries as well  uh  and I have  besides being and engineer  I have a lot practice with team work and with leadership roles in my community and my student groups  even in my p-set groups  um  doing homework. We have to pull together a lot of presentations and a lot of  uh  group reports where the materials signs major here  and  I've really  uh  I've developed a lot of skills that I think will really help your company.  \", \"Do you consider yourself a team player?  Give me an example where there\\u2019s a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it.\": \"Okay so I\\u2019m a junior here at MIT  I\\u2019m [???]  um and I guess so it\\u2019s an interesting combo but engineering and ECS and I think I just came to MIT thinking I\\u2019d do bioengineering and then I guess I took a program class for the first time my freshman year over IP and I guess I just really fell in love with the logic. I worked in a couple of biology labs and I guess the one frustrating thing is that like experiments take weeks or months to set up sometimes things just go wrong and you don\\u2019t really know why. And then I think I like the instantaneous feedback of like [???] so last year I decided to double major and this year I\\u2019m really checking out the more computer science side of things.\", \"If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?\": \"Okay um so I think I\\u2019m on my class council  so one of the things we have to do was to seven people elected every year our job was to plan events for the class for event unity  just like study breaks but sometimes it goes beyond that. And I guess through that role often times I\\u2019ve um just like seen an idea from inception all the way to it\\u2019s now in planning to like delegating tasks to day of  to day of execution and just following that entirely through. So I guess that just involved first just coming out brainstorming some ideas so like for example this past week on Tuesday  since it\\u2019s a hell week for many people at MIT we decided to have instead of like a big study break where people had to go on campus  we rented out a cookie monster truck from Boston and then just drove around. We had six stops on campus to like it was all the dorms and even across the river to bring the study break to them so people didn\\u2019t have to spend that much time just cookies and hot cocoa. So I guess my role is well I thought of the idea and then just coordinate the people and made shifts to people and designed the stops and then just made sure publicity was good and everything came together in the end.\", \"Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Uh  well  I go to MIT. I'm a senior right now. \", \"Well  thank you.  I appreciate you coming today.\": \"Okay um I think sometimes I can be um a little like  uh like unsure of myself or like doubting when making a very large decision so I guess usually in leadership roles I prefer something like second in command since I do like making sure things get done and like following up to make sure but I always like the fall back of having someone else to consult with to talk about uh my thought process and things like that. And I guess generally I try just to overcome that by basically reaching out to other people like other people on the team or someone else you would maybe not [???] but has experience in the field just to maybe illustrate my thought process  see if they see any flaws  see if they see maybe  a perspective I didn\\u2019t think about and then just generally trying to get more viewpoints so that I feel more confident in my own decision or like I reevaluate it to account for things that maybe I didn\\u2019t think of before.\", \"\\tSo  tell me about your background.\": \"Um so actually that\\u2019s one of the things like I\\u2019m hoping to figure out \\u2026\", \"\\tExcellent. So do you think you\\u2019re a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Okay.\", \"\\tDo you think of yourself as a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Okay so I guess the job I picked was just to listing like Richard Keppel? Where like they listen to a lot of pitches and they decide like what to fund and I think the reason why I want to  should I say why I should or why I want to have that job?\", \"\\tThat makes a lot of sense. So  uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"Okay so why I should have the job is I think at MIT I\\u2019ve gotten a lot of exposure to a lot of different things one is through the breadth of my coursework I guess I\\u2019m in two very different fields. Another is just through my interaction with people on campus like being on class council  being involved in a fraternity   I guess I um I\\u2019ve seen like a lot of different groups of people. And um I guess I\\u2019m just constantly around lots of awesome people with awesome ideas and I really enjoy just listening to them. And then a lot of the times I\\u2019ve helped people to develop maybe they\\u2019ve got a gold mine of a plan and I\\u2019ve helped them work through  especially like sophomores or freshman in the fraternity  putting that plan in action. SO I think that I would be a good candidate because I\\u2019ve had experience listening to ideas  I can identify problem areas just because I have a lot of experience executing those ideas. So I can both see what might be a good idea technically as well as to see if there\\u2019s a good plan to set forth an action and get it done.\", \"\\tWhy do you think you should get the job?\": \"Thank you.\", \"\\tWell  thank you.\": \"Umm  like where I'm from  that type of stuff? Okay  umm  I'm Junior  M.I.T.. I come from South Florida  born and raised  so cold weather's kind of rough for a guy like me but that's alright. It's kind of a nice break from the heat of South Florida. Umm  I've been playing music ever since I was four  so that's kind of been a big part of my life. Umm  but music tech  I mean  technology honestly also  so umm. Course two here  which is Mechanical Engineering  um  but I'm also dabbling in Electrical  looking along for sides of control that type of stuff. Robotics  if you will. And just had one of my  my second or third robot finished last week  which was a freakin' nightmare. But you know  it's ok  it's done  it was  it was a good time  so  yeah. That's  that's what I do. Yeah  umm  I guess that's...\", \"\\tI appreciate your time interviewing  the\\u2026\": \"Yeah  alright.\", \"So  tell me a little bit about your background.\": \"Yeah.\", \"Ok. Thank you. Do you think you're a leader  and why?\": \"Leadership? Um  Well I guess I'm  uh  usually pretty calm and collected  so  if I ever notice  like  in a group setting if someone's like  you know  there's  there's disagreement between the two  like in my robotics group  for example. The two guys  they're best buds  but they often  like  just get really heated  like  you know  I  eff you  why  why don't we just do this  and that type of stuff. So...\", \"Ok. And  do you consider yourself a team player? And can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it.\": \"... In order to  like  keep it going and being productive  someone has to be like you know  just  guys  just calm down and keep doing it  so that's  that's like  just  here and there. Not really super-like I'm in control  you know  at least saying guys  we need to calm down and take a step forward. I feel like that's a little  minor leadership role I've got to take there. Um  other leadership roles  um  I  I play in a group  like a band  jazz group  so I often  you know  we all got to get together  and like  kind of talk. Any  any group setting in which I'm often in  I have to  like  somebody has to take control  and I don't often take control initially  but  you know  if something is not going in a certain direction  or the right direction  I often feel like maybe I can push it there very subtly. So  leadership in a very subtle way  but not in a  like  a bam  I'm telling you what to do.\", \"Great. Ok. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"That's  that's what I like doing.\", \"Ok. And... why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Um  okay  so  for example  the robotics group  um  we worked very last minute  and just having to be one of those things where we were all busy with other things  and we didn't really think about the scheduling  like when it was actually  when the project was actually going to be due. So  um  basically we all had to work really hard  last minute  and  of course  you know  things don't always go according to plan  so we  like  we tried to build one thing  and machine something  and it ended up not being perfect the first time  so we have to go back and redesign it  or re-machine it  so uh  we had to re-machine a few things a couple times. And  you know  it's like  six in the morning  and you've been working in the lab for like  thirteen hours and you've got to keep going  so  you've got to stay positive and keep  and  you know  even though you may not finish  or like  you know  you kind of  you can't really think about not finishing. You just have to go for it  keep finishing  keep working  eventually you're good  with the mind set that you are going to finish. So that's  uh  adversity in that way. Just  you know  always stay positive  and keep looking towards the future  keep working.\", \"So tell me a little bit more about your background.\": \"Okay.\", \" oh ok  great.  Um do you think you're a leader? Tell me why\": \"Uh  yeah sure.\", \"Great!  Do you consider yourself a team player and can you give an example of a time you were on a team and there was a problem and you had to resolve it.\": \"For that job  you mean?\", \"Great! And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Umm  I feel like I know what I'm doing now. Um  I'll say there was a point in time where I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing  and I've been one of those guys that  like  you know  you can apply to a job  and say  you know  yeah  there's no harm in applying  which I've kind of figured out  eventually  yeah there is no harm in applying  I agree. But  at the same time  I feel like there's kind of  like a  an obligation to actually know what you're doing for that job  and right now I feel like I know what I'm doing. At least  a lot more so than I did last year  or even last semester  so at the rate I'm going  I feel like  you know  another semester of classes that I'm taking  I'll really know what I'm doing  and then some more time in the field  or at the job  it'll piece together and I'll actually feel pretty confident. So  that's...\", \"Great! And last question.  Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"... That's why  I guess.\", \"So  can you tell me a little bit more about your background?\": \"Um so I\\u2019m a junior at MIT here and um I\\u2019m a physics major and I uh  yeah  besides classes  I\\u2019m involved in the juggling club and uh let\\u2019s see and I\\u2019m from Pensacola  Florida and I\\u2019ve lived there uh ever since I  I was born there  grew up there and I um yeah  lived there and moved up here. Yeah I\\u2019m in Zeta Psy fraternity and uh yeah so  yeah  right above Chicago Pizza. And uh yeah do you want me to go into more detail  or just general? Yeah  um yeah so I uh I don\\u2019t too much as far as extra-curricular but I was involved with Frisbee freshman year for a little bit and played the club team  there\\u2019s not a varsity team here. I was pretty good  liked that a lot. And uh I\\u2019m not sure as far as career wise what I want to go into but as a physics major I\\u2019m looking into something technical probably electrical engineering related. Uh and yeah but I\\u2019m trying to size that up right now. Junior\\u2019s a pretty pivotal year for you know deciding long term things. Yeah so brief summary of me.\", \"Okay. So. Do you think you're a leader and tell me why?\": \"Um so that would most commonly have been this past semester  I took junior lab which is the physics lab class. Lots of challenges frequently. It was me and a partner who worked on three different experiments and um specifically I guess let me think because yeah we had three major experiments and the second experiment was very hands on which was cool but it also means there was a lot of faulty equipment. I guess just a general thing we both learned to kind of talk it through because it\\u2019s so easy to I don\\u2019t know get like get in your head and you\\u2019re working with somebody so they\\u2019ll be thinking one thing and you\\u2019ll be thinking another. Yeah I guess that\\u2019s not very specific but I mean yeah that\\u2019s the first thing that came to mind so.\", \"Oh wow  okay.\": \"Yeah weakness? I guess I uh as far as this is kind of a general thing that I\\u2019ve kind of come to the realization of recently. I need to um I don\\u2019t know I\\u2019ve been kind of getting along with my undergraduate career and you know what I\\u2019ll do after. Self-advocacy is like a huge thing and I haven\\u2019t really gotten too much into that but I feel like a major thing for like taking the next step like after graduation is like self-advocacy. Whether it\\u2019s like having your own website or just like general networking. I don\\u2019t know that\\u2019s something that I realize that I need to kind of work on.\", \"Great. Alright. Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team that you had to resolve.\": \"Um yeah.\", \"Okay. If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Why do I think I should have this job?\", \"Great. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Um I feel like I\\u2019m a pretty creative person and you know having a bit of technical background here and a good work ethic I feel like I really do have those strengths. Yeah I feel like I communicate pretty well for um  I\\u2019m not saying you know general physics majors can\\u2019t communicate well  just in general I feel like especially this past semester I\\u2019ve taken a lab classes I\\u2019ve been able to give a lot of oral presentations and um I kind of found a strength there and so I think kind of bringing a solid communication element to a technical field is pretty important. So um yeah I feel I\\u2019m pretty qualified there.\", \"So  please tell me more about your background.\": \"Uhm  I do  I would say that when situations present themselves I step up to the occasion.  I\\u2019m not afraid to take the lead on a project or like.  For example I guess  um  for one of my computer science projects that we were working on a group together one of our teammates wasn\\u2019t working well  I wasn\\u2019t afraid to kind of step up and take the lead  and be like \\u201chey we gotta get this done.\\u201d  And  um  it\\u2019s kind of happened multiple times before I guess.  \", \"Great. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"I\\u2019m doing well\", \"Great. And do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it. \": \"\\tMm-hmm. OK  um  so  um\\u2026 so when I worked for  um  the computer science and artificial intelligence lab in freshman year  I  um  had  had an issue  um  with one of the students I was working with  um  um  and we had a disagreement about how to handle some part of the project. Um  it was  it was more of a mechanical issue about what direction we should take  um  and without getting too into details  I think  um  going back to the leadership issue  um  the way I  the way I handled this issue was  um  to sit down and address the issue very directly  um  and to have a frank conversation about what we both wanted  evaluate where we both were  and  uh  talk through the options and make a decision right there. Not letting an issue linger; um  I think that\\u2019s generally my style. \", \"Great. Okay. And if you were given an option to change on thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"\\tSo from what I\\u2019ve seen so far in the interview and visiting  um  I\\u2019m really excited about this position I think this is somewhere I would fit  where I would fit in a lot. Um  I\\u2019m really excited about what I would be doing and the people I would be working with  and  um  I would just love to sort of get my hands dirty. And  um  I think I\\u2019m pretty well-equipped to do so and to contribute in doing so. Um  so I\\u2019d love that opportunity.\", \"Haha!\": \"\", \"Alright. Okay. And last question: \": \"Um so I am a student here at MIT. I'm a junior studying biology and management. Um  I am very interested in finance  specifically investment banking or consulting. Uh  I've taken a bunch of different management finance classes  as well as interned in business management... uh I've also done laboratory research and I'm working in a small consulting firm part time. As  as of now  so.\", \"Please tell me more about your background.\": \"Um  I think with my academic experience  as well as my internship experiences I have enough uh  past um  data now assessing quantitative work as well as communication skills and leadership experience  um  and I have a nice balance of skills going into the position. And  I am a fast learner. I'm willing to learn on the job  so I think the combination of all that would be good.\", \"I haven't done that yet.\": \"Yea so  Im a member clinical engineering student at MIT  I'm a Junior  um my main focus is in robotics and product design so I'm real interested in personal robotics and robotic side helps people on a daily basis.\", \"Um do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"became interested in engineering in high school when I did a summer internship at a lab at materials science lab at UC Berkley  and since then I've taken  uh  several courses related to circuits and other eletrical engineering topics. And worked at  uh  electrical engineering labs at Standford and MIT. And  I've also worked in places like Promex Industries  which is a chip packaging company in the Silicon Valley.\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? And can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team  and you had to solve it.\": \"Um  and  as of  so  we need a lot of money for sponsorship. But  as of the end of last year  the website was pretty much defunct. So  I decided to take over as webmaster and one of my  and  over the summer and the beginning of the school year. I set up a new one that's nicely designed  and to get it up  I had to work with most of the other sub-team leaders to get information that I needed. For instance  the specs of the car  pictures of the car  different events for PR and things like that. And  it's done now  so it's online now.\", \"Great! Okay. If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Uh  in terms of what I enjoy in computer science  I really like front end stuff. I've done a lot of web development. I worked at Google last Summer \", \"[Laughs]\": \"But I think also  uh  as a technical person it's  it's e- especially useful to have those skills because they are more rare. So in that sense I do think I'm a leader  because I possess both  you know  technical skills and then also the ability to communicate really well. So the pairing of that really does lend itself well to leadership roles.\", \"Okay. And  last question. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"So I think  y'know  just that qualification in itself really lends m- my  uh  myself to leadership.\", \" Please tell me a little bit more about your background.\": \"Cuz I'm a pretty confident person so there's not a lot of things. I don't often think about this. I guess... ... I wish that  uhm... ... I wish I had the ability to  uh  I guess stop and enjoy the moment a little bit more. \", \" Oh  ok great.  And do you think you are a leader?  Tell me more.\": \"I think because I am very ambitious and I really enjoy life  I'm always going and moving and doing things  and I think there's times where it is better to just relax and enjoy whatever's happening in your life. Uh  but  you know  I'm young  so I like to try a lot of new things. And that's a consequence of that. \", \"Ok.\": \"Um  I think I'm a team player because  I'm willing to agree to others peoples um ideas um the question was a  what was  sorry could you repeat the \", \" Great  ok.  Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of when there was a conflict within your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Uh  so I mentioned this before  but I think I'm qualified in a lot of respects  both technically and in my communication skills. So that's just a balance that you don't see a lot  uh  especially in the computer science field. So I think I can bring a lot to the table in terms of that  uh  in terms of just leadership skills and my ability to talk to people  but also my ability to understand  uh  technical concepts. And especially working in a technical company that's incredibly important.\", \" Ok.  \": \"So I think I have a good balance of that and you're not going to find a lot of candidates like that.\", \" Great.

And last question  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Okay. Okay. Um all right. Um  so I guess I'll start out with uh I decided to go to MIT as my undergrad school. \", \" Great!\": \"Because I wanted a strong education in science and math. And um MIT I found would be one of the best places to develop my problem-solving skills and my uh quant--my quantitative skills  which is really valuable  I feel um for employers nowadays  and so I can certainly say that [laugh] it's I have definitely got a lot better at  like  learning how to solve problems working with others  um and it's also given me like a lot of opportunity  MIT has given me a lot of opportunity to  you know  test out my leadership skills by having so many different student groups. \", \"How have you been?\": \"Um in particular um  I've like  I feel that um my position as the 2014 treasurer my freshman year was uh really critical in helping me develop um  you know  time management skills  interpersonal skills--\", \"All right so can you tell me a little bit more about your background\": \"--and communicating with like not only your like not only with like um people who are at  you know  adults who are older than you  and working with people in different offices  but also with  like  your peers.\", \"Great and do you think you\\u2019re a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Um similarly  um in training students club  I've found um that where I've taken a leadership role as a cultural chair that  unlike in say  high school  you need to really spearhead um efforts to like throw large events yourself  and that's like it's really given me um a feel of what it's like to sort of  you know  take on the responsibility of like organizing an event.\", \"Great okay.

As I've  I've shared with you previously  I um have taken um positions with great responsibility in the student groups I'm involved in  and as well in my major  I uh am I am inv-- uh  I'm in biological engineering  and I think that I've taken a lot of initiative in finding  you know  ways to like test out the concepts I learn in class outside of class by finding uh research positions and later lab um where the weekly lab meetings has really helped me  you know  improve my communication skills with presenting information to an audience. \", \"Great okay last question. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Mm-hm.\", \"Tell me a little more about your life.\": \"I had to work in teams--in everything I've had to do so far  from academics to my work experience. Um in my start-up internship my freshman year um and my corporate internship my sophomore year. Um everything was I had to learn how to um not only do the task that was given to me  but to also sort of be able to  you know  delegate tasks to who I was working with and carry out what was  what was asked of me  as well. Um last summer  I was a year  um I did an international year off in Thailand  and my lab partner um was a graduate student who was older than me  but I was  we were partners on the project--\", \"Mmmmhmm.\": \"--because we also did have to  like  live together. \", \"Great. So  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Being Americans abroad  we really stayed together for most of it  so I felt that being just like really honest and transparent with her was um the best way um just to like say  what about you know say  you know  just like speak up about our frustrations  but also like to  to compliment on  like  the things that are done well. I think that's what really helped. \", \"OK. Could you be a little bit more specific?\": \"Um so  one thing I wish I was better at was um you know speaking well when put on the spot. [Laugh] I tend to  when I'm nervous  I tend to  you know  not really focus on what I'm saying  because I'm trying not to mess up--\", \"Right. OK. Do you consider yourself a team player?\": \"Um is something that I would like to improve.\", \"And can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Okay. Um so I think that I can bring like with the the my skills and experience is um someone who is really can work well under stress. I may not talk well under stress-- [laughs]\", \"Mmmhmm\": \"--but I can work well under stress. Um I think my academic being um you know having the rigorous undergraduate curriculum at MIT has made me really hone my time management skills. Um the other week I had to juggle um um  you know  throwing together a large event for a student's club  um and have meetings with cultural chairs of the other clubs. Um I've also had to  at the same time there was a big event that my sorority was organizing that I also have to help contribute to. \", \"Oh\": \"And  like  uh my  I had a friend who's also going through a tough time  so I had to  like  help her out. That  and then complete school work.

Ok  so  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"--and just being able to balance all of that. Um and so far um I think that  like  my experiences um that I was able to be on top of all of those deadlines. Not only now  but  like  in the past  and I think that says a lot about um my ability to  you know  work hard and also  you know  balance out my lifestyle.\", \"Mmmhmm. Can you give me an idea of what those are?\": \" Umm  I think that definitely over the MIT  my MIT career  I've evolved more as a leader.\", \"Great. And... why do you think you should get this job?\": \" Umm  yea ok.  So  conflict.  Umm  well i guess I'll use an example from last year for Glommid.  Umm  so we were partnered with a different organization last year  and we  what  how it works is a national organization  theres fifty chapters  umm and we had a partner in Laos  and all of a sudden last minute  they said we could no longer go and implement the project.  So I was the person in charge of organizing the trip  that my role on exec  so that was really hard for me because I felt kind of betrayed kind of by the co-presidents and by nationals umm  because the reason was because the Laotian government would see us volunteer tourism and they could get their NGO status revoked since Laos just started having NGO's.  So that was something I kind of was unsure about like are we sure we can go here  like Laos is very not welcoming towards Americans because of  past.  And so  I felt really kind of let down by umm  by them.  And I think everyone on the Glommid team also felt really let down  because it was February  we had been fundraising all year  planning campaigns  umm and this  so what we did I think  umm  like I switched over to campaigns coordinator and I still like tried to keep everyone invested and excited for our campaign to still fundraise for them  because it wasn't because they were a bad organization that we couldn't go  it was because that the government wouldn't allow it  and we didn't want to risk them losing their NGO status for a project.  Umm  so what  I  went through the campaign  I tried to get people to focus more  just remember what our partner does  why we are doing this  umm and not focus so much on kind of the miscommunication that happened between nationals and the partner organization.  Umm  and then through this summer  and through this fall i've been trying to keep in contact with our partner  our old partner  although we are repartnered now  umm  to see how our  the money we raised like how that project is going and to try and keep people informed about what's going on  so that it doesn't feel like last year was a complete failure.\", \"So uh please tell me a little more about your background.\": \" Uh  I think I should get the job because I think what my assets are I combine Econ and health  which is kind of rare to have as an undergraduate to have this combination.  And I've done  I've taken a lot of classes  I'm involved in a national development  both from the technical side of Econ  the anthropological and the health side.  And also my involvement in Glommid has also taught me a lot about the realities of international health and international development that I don't think necessarily come through a class.\", \"oh ok.\": \"Been all right. School\\u2019s uh  you know  it\\u2019s always that time in the middle of the semester. Yeah it\\u2019s nuts.\", \"Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why?\": \"Um yes so I am a junior here at MIT in Computer Science and Engineering um and most of my experience here has been actually at the Game Lab on campus so I\\u2019ve worked there for the past few years and I\\u2019ve worked on many different kinds of projects in various languages and with different people. Um and uh also uh I\\u2019ve taken courses here in algorithms  uh in graphics  uh also software construction. But I\\u2019ve really found algorithms to be something that I\\u2019m really interested in  I think they\\u2019re really beautiful and elegant  they can accomplish a lot. And in my spare time I like to um do yoga  I\\u2019m not very good at it  and I love food so finding hidden gems in the city is really fun.\", \"okay. Do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and how you resolved it?\": \"Uh yes I am. So um last semester here at MIT I took  as I mentioned  a software construction class and um in this class we had you know quite a few projects and some of these were group projects. So the first group project that we had in the class  um I was working with uh two of my peers. They seemed um like nice people and all but we were having issues um you know actually getting things done. Getting a time when we could all meet and um you know that sort of thing. So uh it looked like no one was really stepping up so I decided to step up and um I made sure to contact everyone in the group and um you know got us working together um and we met up. And you know I made sure that we were always on task and took notes on what we were doing um so that when it came to actually implementing our ideas that we actually had some sort of structure and our project turned out really great uh at the end. There was a bit of a time crunch but all in all I think we worked together really well and I\\u2019m very pleased with how it turned out.\", \"Good!And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"I do consider myself a team player. Um worked on many teams. So in this same software construction class ironically the second group project which was our final project for the course did not go quite as planned. So I was working with two other people and uh in this case I tried to get us working together and tried to do my part for our project but uh they were not having it and um they actually ended up overwriting my code multiple times instead of you know allowing me to contribute to the project um even after I spoke to them about it and told them there were tools um that could help resolve conflicts in the code and they just weren\\u2019t cooperating. Um and so I ended up having to go talk to my TA and talking to my course administrator here and also to the student support services to see you know what  how I could resolves the situation because I had done everything that I thought I could. Um so that turned out okay at the end but sometimes things are out of your control and I think those are the hardest problems to confront but um you know uh it\\u2019s okay to ask for help sometimes I think that it ended up okay in the end.\", \"okay! And last question  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Ooh  that\\u2019s a toughie. Hmm I think  if I had one thing I could change it would probably be being more aggressive  which aggressive is a scary word perhaps so um perhaps being more assertive. I\\u2019ve always been a pretty quiet person um even when I was growing up and this is something that like in elementary school my teachers would say that  \\u201cOh\\u201d you know on my progress reports  \\u201c[Stephie?] Is a very quiet and sweet girl\\u201d but they didn\\u2019t really have anything else to say because I was so quiet. Um and you know even now sometimes being around people can make me nervous and this is something that I\\u2019ve been working on um you know over you know since I can remember I guess. And as of late I\\u2019ve been trying to take a more active role in you know overcoming my fear of people. Uh I uh a few years ago worked at a Starbucks for about a year. Yeah back in  this was in downtown Boston in the financial district  so of all the customers you could possibly have at a Starbucks  these were the probably the most challenging ones that you could have. So after working there and dealing with these people I feel like I can pretty much you know  I can deal with anyone even if it makes me sort of nervous. Um you know I\\u2019ve been there so I can sort of take my experiences form there and apply them to what I encounter nowadays.\", \"Tell me a little bit about you  okay?\": \"OK  um... this is separate from the other time  right?\", \"Great! So  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"OK (laughs)  um  I'm a junior  um  at MIT studying environmental engineering. Um  I'm originally from Minnesota. Um  I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology and environmental transport and I found them really interesting. \", \"Well okay. Great! Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"And I thought that they would apply to this job. \", \"Great  okay. Um  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Um  yeah. (Laughs)\", \"Good! Okay  and why do you think should get the job?\": \"Um  yeah  I think I've stepped up to a lot of leaderslip  -ship positions since I came to college. I'm president of my living group  um   I'm also on the rowing team and I feel like I've  um  played a leadership role there  um...\", \"Can you tell me a little bit more about your background?\": \"Um  so  as president of my living group  um  I lead house meetings every other week \", \"Oh  great! So do you think you are a leader?\": \"and I also am involved in resolving problems between people  um  so there's like several different conditions in the house which control  like  say for instance  like  buying food  or like  maintaining the house and I help coordinate everybody and make sure they can work together. \", \"Great! So do you consider yourself a team player? And can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Mmmhmm.\", \"Okay. So if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"So like  kind of chores  and so we've definitely had conflicts over  like  people who aren't pulling their weight in the house  and there were times I had to step in and take the person aside and let them know that they were adversely affecting the group and that there were  like  consequences if they didn't  um   end up  you know  pulling more weight  and I definitely had success with that and  um  one particular instance I talked to someone and she came back to the next house meeting and apologized to the group  and...\", \"And last question. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"... definitely started to change her behavior.\", \"Good! Can you tell me some more about your background?\": \"And  um  there's definitely things I'm working on growing in...\", \"Mmm Hmm\": \"One thing about myself... being more on top of my work. Something that I definitely need for myself is a deadline and I've always been like that. If you don't give me a deadline sometimes I'll end up dragging my feet  and things get done at the last minute and it's just... disorganization. And so I've been trying to deal with that by making my own small deadlines - personal deadlines - writing them down  making lists and making sure that I prioritize things in advance. But that's something that has taken me probably two years at MIT to learn how to do - and I'm finally getting it.\", \"That's great. Alright. You think you're a leader?  Tell me why.\": \"..which I think helped prepare me. Um  I'm also really excited about going into this field  um  I haven't  b-  had the chance to apply the things I've learned in my classes yet and I think this would be a really good opportunity for me to apply those things  so... I think I would be able to help the company out in that way.\", \"Great. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where you had a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"hmmm well actually statistically I think that I would like to be a little but taller because actually it's true I believe that like taller people are more like uhm they get better like jobs and like they're statistically more likely to succeed just because you're more impressed by a taller person so it's like well sure why not? It would I think it would make it might have some percentage chance of making my life better. Also if I maybe there's like another second thing changing my last name to something that starts with A because thats also showing statistically increase your chances of success.\", \"That's great. Ok. If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"I definitely do consider myself a team player. Um  one time that we experienced some conflict in one of the teams I was working on was actually in one of my Aerospace Engineering classes. In this team  our job was to build an RC airplane - design  build and fly it. And we hit some conflicts within our team because - it was mostly everyone was very busy  everyone was very stressed. It was towards the end of the year when everyone's preparing for finals and it was just a very high-strung environment  and the projects was very involved. It involved machining  it involved design work  and coordination between a team of four. And what ended up happening was  well  we needed to get in and find the time to actually work on our airplane and build it. Whereas all of us were involved in student groups and had a very heavy courseload. And conflict did arise. And how we ended up solving this was we - we all decided that something needed to change. And we realized that we weren't putting together quality work when we were doing two people at a time or two people coming in or someone cancelling at the last minute - things like that. We ended up just having to sit down  lay it all out  discuss whatever we needed to do to make sure that we're all here - we're all committing the right amount of time towards this project. And  honestly it was just very much a group effort and we all sat down and individually realized that we needed to prioritize. And I needed to put my classes above some of my interests and my hobbies. And that was something that we all decided to do as a group.\", \"Great and why do you think you should get the job?\": \"I think I should get the job because I have a very interesting background  and I believe that I have very unique experiences that could add a lot to your organization. As someone with an engineering background but - as well as a management background because I am minoring in management at MIT. And I think that combination adds a lot to the environment that you would like to have at your company. I think putting a lot of people together in one environment trying to work on the same projects with the same background is something that is very limiting. And I believe that I could add quite a bit of diversity and unique perspective to your team.\", \"Good. Tell me more about your background. \": \"I've danced my whole life and continued to do so at MIT and I'm studying biology currently and for my humanities concentration  concentrating on Spanish.\", \"Yea  yea  introduce yourself again. You don't have to worry about...\": \"I would say definitely in various aspects of my life I try to step up as a leader. I'm currently involved in an internship through HELLO at MIT and so the point of the internship is to act as a peer network engagement intern. So basically  reaching out to other Jewish students at MIT  who may not be looking for a very religious atmosphere. But would just like to know that there are other Jewish students that they could connect with. And so my role as the leader of the situation is to connect various students who have similar interests either in community service or things like that and sort of set up a network for them. \", \"No  I know  I know  I know. I don't know why it's worded like that.\": \"Sure  I definitely hope that I'm a team player.\", \"MMmm-hmmm. \": \"I think. It's definitely important to have leadership qualities but also to be able to mesh well within a group. I think this comes out a lot in lab settings where everyone from undergraduate students to PhD candidates and post Docs really have to work together on similar projects. And so being able to voice your opinions or your concerns about experiments while still taking the feedback from others  and making it more of a group effort than a hierarchy  I would say would be crucial.\", \"Oh  wow. \": \"I think  if I could change one thing it would probably be to have a little bit more self confidence. I think I externally try to project a calm and outgoing personality  but inside I can tend to be a little bit shyer. And so I think just being able to walk into any kind of either social or business related situation and really have that confidence without having to second guess myself would help move along both career wise and just with relationships with other people. \", \"Okay  Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why. \": \"\", \"Mmm-hmmm\": \"Well I'm a junior at MIT and currently I'm majoring in Computer Science and molecular biology with a minor in Management. Um  my work background  I've done a year op at uh  in Boyden's Lab  uh which is in neurobiology lab and I really like that  but I'm interested in maybe pursuing Finance as a career. So  the past two summers  um  I've worked in financial services. Um  my freshman summer I worked at Standard & Poor's  and last summer I worked at Wells Fargo.  \", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it? \": \"I'm good  how are you?\", \"Great. If you were given the offer to change one thing about yourself  what would it be? \": \"Ok  um I'm Kathleen  I'm a Core 16 major here at MITU  that's um aeronautical and astronautical engineering  if you're not familiar with our numbering system. Um  so I've been taking a lot of classes in aeronautical and astronautical engineering. Including some um propulsion classes  um uh principals of automatic control  um dynamics  aerodynamics  um computer engineering  so I am familiar with job and mat lab  Um  and then also within those classes I've done some lab work. Um  including work on um a remote control airplane. Um  which we did for a competition last spring. Um  it was in teams of three. Um  my team  and the the goal is to maximize the ratio of the um the turn rate times the pay turn rate squared times the pay load.\", \"Mmm-hmmm mm-hmmm. \": \"Um  my team worked really hard on that um and uh we ended up coming in second  um.\", \"Mmm-hmm mmm-hmmm mmm-hmm \": \"Which was exciting  a little bit disappointing but [laughter] still it was still a really fun project that we worked on. Um  and then also done internships with  um my most recent one was with NASA Glenn Research Center  um and I worked on two projects for that. Um  one was a Venus rover conceptual design. Um  which was where we were trying to basically just figure out what the fees-ability would be for a small low cost rover on Venus  um that would be able to fit within the budget of a discovery class mission. Um  and then  so that one was mostly  um there was a lot of research  a lot of um  pulling the other information from different areas  kind of because it's not really a thing that people have looked at very closely before. There's not a lot of information on the topic of how things perform in uh 450 degrees C in 90 atmospheres of pressure. It's kind of a specific thing.\", \"Great. Why do you think you should get the job? \": \"Um  so it was um a lot of just like trying to figure out  like what would work  what wouldn't work. Um  a lot of flexibility in the designs since it was in early stages  um and a lot of  um there's some  some mat lab you know and analysis and um coding involved with that to. Um  then the second project that we worked on for that internship was um an autonomous navigation system for small payloads um and that was an intern team project. There was totally designed and run by me and a group of seven other interns. Um  so that was outside of work hours. We were putting together  um it was uh steerable [inaudible] parachute. \", \"Good! Tell me more about your background.\": \"Um  and I think that I've shown that through my work on my projects. Um  being willing to  to make decisions  take chances with something um that may or may not work  but it's wi ...  it's important to be able to try things to figure out if that's gonna be the case or not.\", \"Great  okay. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Um and I think that  uh especially like in the  the Venus rover and um also with the dropson project  um since those were two projects where there weren't a lot of uh specific design constraints imposed on us from the start \", \"Great. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"It was really important to just  um to just take an idea and run with it. Run the equations  um drop it off a building  in the case of the dropson  [laughter] um and just see what happened  um.\", \"Conflict on your team\": \"So that was something that I got to be pretty comfortable with doing.\", \"Great. If you were given an offer to change one thing about yourself  what would it be? \": \"Uh  yes and yes. [laughter] Um  I need a  so especially with the intern team project  when there were eight of us involved in this team  um and that was a kind of unique experience in that there was really no like hierarchy of um control or anything it was just eight interns and we were all on equal footing. All had pretty equal experience and backgrounds  um so there wasn't really anyone who was specifically in charge of that project  um and that involved a lot of give and take. Um and so  I think one of the biggest uh conflicts we faced as a team was when we were just deciding  at the very beginning what our project was going to be. \", \"Great; and why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Um and this was going to be something that was gonna uh be a pretty significant part of the next ten weeks of our summer. So it was pretty important for us to choose something that was gonna  was gonna go well. Um  so the it ended up being a uh fairly difficult decision between the uh a design project for uh a small re-entry vehicle versus the autonomous navigation system that we did. Um  and how we handled it um was we just kind of  we all came together and had um a round table sort of a discussion. Um  we implemented hand raising uh rules\", \"So uh.. please tell me about your background.\": \"Um we  we just voted on it um with secret ballet  wrote down what our decision  what decision we wanted  um we counted up the votes and then we just went with that decision. Um and I think that um  for me and for the other interns on the team as well  it was really important that everyone recognize that whatever the outcome of the vote was  was that's what we were gonna do um and we would all get on board with that project right away. Um and that's what happened  um and there wasn't any like uh  real I don't know bitterness or resentment about doing the project that we did. I think it pretty well.\", \"That sounds really interesting. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Um I would make it so that I was more organized. I often struggle to meet deadlines  when I have a lot of them piled together. Not because the work is hard  but because I just forget that the deadlines are coming.\", \"So uhm thinking about all those teams  and where you were a team player. Tell me about a time when there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it. \": \"Um  so I think that that's something that I could really work on um and I have been working on that [laughter] um by keeping notebooks and writing down uh schedules of important dates  um asking friends to help me out if I know that there's something we're working on together and it's at the deadline or just an assignment that we both have and there's a deadline. Asking for a reminder um from my more talented friends  um and keeping my Google calendar up to date as well has been helping with that.\", \"Interesting  some of that is interesting  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"Um I think I should get this job because I am uh I am well qualified for it. I've done projects that are um  they are in the same type of area and I think that my experiences from them will really carry over so I can contribute to this job. Um and uh I think that I can also  um I mean I've also shown that I'm  I am a team player and a leader so I think that as well as my technical expertise  I think that uh my personality fits in well with this job and I really like the environment as well that I've seen. Um um um  employees it seems like there's a lot of enthusiasm for work\", \"Fair enough.\": \"Mmm Hmm\", \"So uh  give about all we talked about today  thanks again for sharing   why do you think  why do you think you should get this job?\": \"um and I think that I would fit in well with that.\", \"Thanks Chase  I apprec.\": \"I'm doing well  thank you.\", \" How are you doing today?\": \"I think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that I could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance. Not that I think I dress very scruffly or anything but I don\\u2019t really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and t-shirt. two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which I wouldn\\u2019t agree at all. but if I cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when I leave the house that would probably be small benefit. given that even though there is a saying don\\u2019t judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you. and they can\\u2019t perhaps if I was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit\", \"Can you tell me more about your background?\": \"Okay  okay  I got confused 'cause you said tell me more.\", \" Great do you think you\\u2019re a leader? Tell me why?\": \"Okay  sorry  okay  I was like wait..Am I supposed to...okay  sorry. Um so I am a junior at MIT studying chemistry and biology. I'm primarily interested in how small molecules interact with biological systems such as um the effects of drugs or uh toxins or other uh metabolites on the body and its cells. \", \"Great  do you consider yourself a team player and can you give me an example of where you were on a team and there was a conflict and you had to resolve it?\": \"I've done research since uh like coming to MIT at in the lab of professor [sounds like] Jonessiben in chemistry and biological engineering. I've been looking at the mechanism of a drug that is currently in phase two clinical trials...\", \"That\\u2019s all right  a class project or anything like that?\": \"...um for treatment of HIV. Umm in addition I have also done organic synthesis to develop um spacers for drug delivery um at the Curie Institute in Paris. \", \"Okay and if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"I think I am a leader. I've done work in my dorm house government as dining chair and environmental chair to take a leadership role um and help residents to um express their concerns with the dining plan \", \"Okay  and why do you think you should get the job?\": \"\", \"I\\u2019m good. Tell me a little more about your background.\": \"I definitely consider myself a team player. I've uh done a lot of work in teams in my chemistry and undergraduate labs.\", \"That\\u2019s great. [laugh] ok  you think you\\u2019re a leader  tell me why.\": \"Trying to figure out how to balance it so everyone gets to ex--um do the lab and have hands on experience while at the same time making sure that things go smoothly and that we work in an efficient manor. Um so it's..it can be difficult to balance these things such that everyone gets a fai-um a fair chance at doing the hands-on component but we generally resolve this by taking turns and the people who are more experienced kind of uh  you know  supervise in almost a mentor-like way the person who has less experience. \", \"And do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give an example of when there was a conflict with your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"And that can create like a negative cycle so if I could change one thing it would be learning how to put bad things behind me and move ahead. It's something I've definitely been working on  and having to work on since I can to MIT where you get used to  you know  a lot of things \", \"Anything where there was a problem that you had to solve.\": \"Not have negative things happen but learning to push through that. \", \"Alright. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Um  so as far as my technical experience background goes; um I've worked in three different labs. Um the summer after my freshman year I worked in a lab through um through MGH and located in Charleston. I worked with a Harvard graduate student on her PH.D Thesis which involved a lot of genetics and I did a lot of like very routine lab work. Um and that was just for the summer  and then the next  um my soft-more year I worked in a lab here at MIT  um the Engelward laboratory that works with DNA damage and I worked on an essay that quantified DNA damage using um electrophoresis. Which was nice because I got to learn a lot of um different laboratory techniques and because I'm still currently working there. I've had the time to delve into the project a little bit more have a deeper understanding than I was initially. Um and it also incorporates um components of coding like we use the math lab area um to um generate our data  so it's been really interesting for me. Um and also this past summer I worked in a laboratory in Israel  which was really interesting they worked with all sorts of bio-sensors um so it's a pretty broad um field that they worked in; and I got to work on my own project. I've never had that type of independent freedom which was really exciting for me. Um and I think what I got more out of that was that just getting used to such a different work place and being able to acclimate myself and um be productive in that sort of environment  so.\", \"Right right right.\": \"Um  think  all I can think is like superficial things like the ability to sing or something like that. Um  I would like to be able to think a little bit faster on my feet  as I took a very long time to answer that question. Um I think I've given time I think I can come up with like good ideas and good responses and like handle issues in a good way. Um and I think that just being able to think of something a little bit quicker I know that sometimes there's like  times of crisis and it takes me a little bit longer than I would like to be able to um come up with the like ideal solution. So that would be one of my things I'd like to change. I think I'm able to combat it pretty well by  taking steps to you know mitigate the situation like handle it but ultimately that would be one thing I'd like to improve on.\", \"Right  good. And what  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Uhm..I would I..I would go this.. I I would say there is kind of uhm from two standpoints both from high school and from college  in high school I was the captain of our ultimate frisbee team..uhm and so I started it in my junior year and just got all my friends  because we used to play frisbee all with each other and I said hey  why don't we start competing and make this happen liek three times a week or soemthing and so we went ahead and did this and uhm.. uh started practicing enough and I had to make sure that everything was coordinated and that people actually came to practices  I mean you like had to have everyone come and everything otherwise no one is going to wanna play or there is going to be no ability to play basically.. so uhm we  played enough so that we were actually able to get 3rd in uhm well actually 3rd in my senior year  5th my junior year and uh in the state of texas in frisbee which is uh impressive without a coach. Uh  otherwise I was also the captain of the crosscountry team and uhm  uh captain of uhm uh the track team as well  so uhm that um roles been more minimal  more of an inspirational role like make sure you come to practice sort of thing. of stuff and uhm in college here I've been working with a group called saftey fp and uh  which promotes student wellness around campus  sounds like you've heard of it. uhm and yeah  so just making sure we have awesome events that happen  I just recently read an event called super smash bros turned in which was really great  uhm..I don't know anything about super smash bros  so... I had to actually go get the the other people that knew a lot about it and made sure they told all their friends about it  and got them to actually figure out the whole thing the whole logistics and that wa sme just getting them excited about it  and and convinced them to get a lot of people to come.\", \"How are you today?\": \"Uh yes  I would say that I am a leader. Um in particular I've been involved in many student groups on campus such as educational studies program  mystery hunt and several other groups that I have leaderships positions in. But even when I don't have a formal leadership role as I do in those groups  I feel like I still tend to take charge in situations  whether it's a group project for the class where  you know we're supposed to be working collaboratively but I'll be sending emails to make sure we're moving forward and making progress. Or something a bit more structured actually supposed to have a have a leader like I mentioned student groups. \", \"Good! You seem a little out of breath.\": \"And like in thsi case  i would definitely go for uhm actually my ability to  speak ah hah and uhm just in general and uh like I find for now for example  like how I kind of seem like I understand what I'm tlaking about for exmample  for the most part  I  *mumbles* everynow and then but uhm what I'm actually thinking about harder problems and I'm trying to explain myself where I just worked on a hard problem I only looked at once so I don't fully understand everything  for the most part I get it in my head but when I try and explain it to someone  i it's actually pretty hard to me. And to uhm..everything in an uhm I guess interesting manner  well almost and kind of say it once instead of say something and then which is what I do freqently and then I say oh wait that does not make sense  let me try another avenue. I just keep trying different avanues until the other person gets it  but I would love to be able to just give it that first time  I can just think for a second and say okay this is exactly what I need to say. Use the vocabulary words I need to use  which frankly I'm not that good at  and in terms of expanding my vocabulary and expanding my words for whatever like dictionary or see I don't even know the word  like my expanse of the vocabulary that exists in my head and uh on an given and at any given time  not as large as it should be. \", \"Um  so tell me more about your background.\": \"Uhm  So I know  I.. I would say it just comes down to the passion for the most part  I just really enjoy anything that I am working on  if I am ever going to pck something to work on  i bascially just go at it full force  I always tlak to my friends about it  it's always on my mind in the shower  it's like always in the top of my mind  I am working on a problem and I have to get that problem finished  and I basically  I never really feel like suffer from burn out  that may be because I haven't worked on soemthing enough uhm but uhm  for the msot part  i really enjoy working on stuff and I just  it's my passion and my passion is actually just like working  when i get tired of working  i work on something else  it's actually a relaxing state  like if I am working here for example  I do hard in all my classes  I just start programming. I feel in a great place  I'm either working out or working on soemthing  I I I I think your company woudl love to see someone like that.\", \"Ok  do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"I think that I ca be a leader. I am definitely not one that tends to lead. I am perfectly happy to play a more supportive role  because in my experience especially here there are plenty of people who like to lead and leaders are not needed. That said if there\\u2019s something that needs to be done and nobody is stepping up to do it that is something that I can and will adapt to\", \"Karen  given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"So to be honest I haven\\u2019t experienced major conflicts in general. Honestly I think it is best to keep open terms of communication I that makes it so that you can\\u2019t have a disaster happen. There can be minor disagreements but they never turn into big conflicts.\", \"And uh  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Because I think I would do a great job for you guys. I care a lot about my work especially when it affects other people and I really like what this company is doing. It is something that I believe in.\", \" Good.  Tell me more about your background.\": \"You can see it I if you look online uh author rank was my intern product. \", \" Great.  Um  do you think you're a leader.  Tell me why.\": \"Um\\u2026 I have some leadership experience but I think that so in my teens for 6172  which is a project based live class \\u2026 it\\u2019s been a lot of work. Um I tend to be the person who does some of the organizing of team meetings but mostly within a given meeting I tend to be  like  for a non-trivial portion of the work.  The person who is leading the discussions of what\\u2019s the next technical step we should do  you know  should we take approach A or   should we take approach A or B based on time  work  you know  man hours we have  due dates  uh points  etcetera. Um  and so I  you know  perform leadership skills in a technical capacity more than a managerial one. \", \" Great.  Do you consider yourself a team player.  Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.\": \"In a sense that I don\\u2019t do so much of the organizing of meeting times.\", \" Great.  If you had the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Um  I do think I\\u2019m a team player  um so  can I ask what kind of flavor of conflict you\\u2019re looking for?

And why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Ok  um  well while I was working at Amazon  um we had many times the problem that the business decision would change or um become apparent slowly over time as we continued designing because actually the design process started getting [] over the internship and the product shipped shortly after my internship []\", \"Good!...Tell me more about your background.\": \"And um trying to decide what things would be worked on and what wouldn\\u2019t was a conflict of the team um and I did my best  um  you know I was an intern  um but I did my best to like present the technical issues  present my understanding of how long things would take  um  and try to you know  encourage people to take the direction they wanted but in the case that a choice was made that wasn\\u2019t you know  what I wanted  uh you know I would go along with it.  I wasn\\u2019t you know going to be petulant or continue trying to you know argue my way and not do their way  like if the team decided this was the best thing like I went ahead and did it.\", \"Great... Do you think you're a leader?

Um  I so- always end up taking the lead on uh when there's a big group and someo-someone has to start ha  taking the wheel and uh getting people started working. Um  I've been really involved in the groups that I've -heheh  joined since my freshman year and uh so far I've done some pretty crazy things such as organizing a hundred plus networking event for the armenian society where I definitely had to um  you know uh work with uh the team and get them motivated enough to help me with this like big task  a lot of people-a lot of kids on my team don't really like the whole social um event planning part of things  but um I had to kind of engage them and uh that was an interesting thing for me to learn actually how to tap into what makes people take and what gets them motivated so how to give them initiative to do things on their own so. \", \"Okay...\": \"\", \"Right...If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Um  and I think most importantly  computer science is a huge part of my life and what I do and I fully and legitimately enjoy my job  especially if you give interesting technical problems Um and I\\u2019m sure that\\u2019s what your company will do right?\", \"Mmhmm...Well  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"I'm good how are you? \", \"Hi  how are you doing today?\": \" Yeah uh definitely  I-I-I would say that I'm a team player and um one thing I can say is that uh last year at the MIT  MIT undergraduate research role we uh had to publish an issue uh in the fall where it became late and we had to uh work together as a team to get that done. uh one  one thing that may  I may have done wrong on my part was maybe I-I-I didn't um get my department to uh work hard enough to get the deadline  make the deadline so um in the spring semester when we were trying to uh make it make uh make the deadline in the spring semester to publish uh in the first week of the spring semester I had to do the same thing that I did with our (research?) I-or was get everyone to be motivated and have initiative to do things on their own and really like work hard to get t-ah that deadline so yeah.\", \"Good  tell me about your background. \": \"mhmm\", \"Great... Do you think you are a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Interesting question. Uh I would change my lack of willingness that sometimes to approach new people and you know put myself into new situations that I'm not comfortable with. Um I-I definitely have the-the whatever I am comfortable with I feel very confident and I come off as confident at the moment heh  but  um  I sometimes I'm-I-whenever I approach those new situations I'm pretty  I'm pretty shy and I-I don't I don't feel comfortable so one thing I would like to change my- about myself is being more adventurous and being more of a risk-taker and I-I feel like I'm too controlled at times but that has gotten me also a-ha very far but it's always good to be a balanced person.\", \"Great...Do you consider yourself a team player  and can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.\": \"Hahahaha\", \"mmhmm\": \"K So I'm a good leader  as I uh said I uh organize a team of around 10 people to organize 100+ networking event people networking event  Um I have this ability to understand people where like I which I have to do when I uh have to uh get people to be motivated and like realize what made them take and what made them have initiative on their own so I have a good sense of understanding people um and third  I like I said I'm very controlling  like y-know not controlling but  wrong word  controlled  haha I-I like to uh really get organized and really um put alot of effort into sort of you know um I guess I guess perfecting every aspect of the-a project that I'm working on whether it be an event  a-a-a homework assignment  whatever so uh I have that ability as well.\", \"OK. \": \"Yep.\", \"And  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" So  my background is primarily in energy work.  So  I'm a chemical engineering student and I'm very interested in not only alternative energy but the optimization of our traditional energy resources.  Um  so that's  that's where my  uh  background in  well in gas comes in.  Um  but also some of my research interests are you know  kind of scientific ideas.\", \"Okay - \": \"\", \"Okay...and  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Um  I definitely think I am.  Uh  partially because even when I'm not the designated leader somehow it turns into me leading the team.  But I really enjoy that.  I think that one of the most satisfying feelings is having your team tel you that you're doing a great job or that they think that um that success can be highly attributed to you.  So  I think that in terms of my leadership style I always want to bring out the strengths of  the team members.  So I think that's really how my position as a leader really works.  I try to figure out what would maximize the potential of this team member or that team member.  And how can we bring all of those together.\", \"Good  I am doing well. Tell me more about your background.\": \"Um  yeah  so  I definitely consider myself a team player.  It's tough to be a good leader without being a good team player.  Ah  but one instance where I was both the leader and also a team player um  was in the Society of Women Engineers banquet.  So  when we planned it  it was...I'm the vice president of corporate relations and I have six people who work with me and we planned a banquet for about 200 people  both company representatives and students.  And um  and it's a very collaborative effort.  Like  I may be the VP but we're all you know  pulling a lot of the weight.  And so during the actual event  we had four company representatives for two different companies show up to the event without RSVP-ing or anything.  Uh  it was  the selection for the companies was pretty extensive and the selection for the students was pretty extensive.  So what we were trying to do was get a good range of industries and then match students with their interests.  So it's not something where you can be like  Oh yeah  sit right down but  so  in terms of being a team player  they approached one of the other members of the team.  She didn't really know what to do um  kind of bounced it to a few different people but I knew that that was something that wouldn't look good.  So I definitely helped her out  out of that awkward situation and kind of took the blame on myself essentially because these representatives were pretty angry that  Oh  you don't have our name tags  you don't have our seats?  What's going on?  And so I  you know  part of being a team player is knowing when it's best to take the blame on yourself.  And in the end we found places for them to sit.  So  we had some no-show students  you know  among like a hundred whatever students you definitely have people that don't show up.  So they didn't get to sit with like exactly the right students or anything but we found them a place and fed them dinner.  So  that helped.\", \"Do you think you are a leader? Tell me why?\": \"\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player and give me a example when you were on the team and there was conflict and you have to resolve.\": \" I wish I was more patient.  Um  I think I  a lot of times and very eager to start a task.  This especially comes out  uh  we're in a lab group right now.  Or  I'm in a lab class and I work with a lab group  um  in that class and we are all  we kind of have this trait of  um  oh as soon as the chemicals are out on the bench  oh let's mix this  let's do this  let's do this.  But a lot of time we end up finishing a little bit later than other groups because we have to  we problem solve.  We get all the problems first  you know  other people not having necessarily tried this we find that this doesn't work at all.  So  we face all those hurdles first whereas if we had  if we could take a few minutes wait  think it out  uh  maybe let somebody else try something first for a change  um  I think that would helps us be a little bit more effective.  And I think in other situations too it's kind of strategic and advantageous to wait but it's sometimes hard for me to see those opportunities.  So I definitely  that's definitely something that I've been working on  is  you know  when  when is that also a viable option to just sit back for a few days and just think about it. \", \"If you were given a option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?\": \"\", \"OK. Why you think you should get the job?\": \"I think that I would bring a great deal of enthusiasm.  In addition to the skills and background that I have  I think that I'm so excited  um  for the work that your company is doing and to kind of play off the other members of the team as well.  Um  so not just stick to my own project but also be contributing to the other projects that are going on and try to find synergies within our team.\", \"Do you think you're a leader? tell me why.\": \"So I am a  uh  mechanical engineer at MIT. Umm  I am a junior  and I'm really interested in product design. So I've been taking a lot of classes in design and manufacturing  and it's something I've really fallen in love with...Like last semester  um  especially  I took this class called...[0:25 unclear] Product Design  and it's really got me introduced to solid works and using machine tools  and it's something that I'd love to do in  um  for the rest of my life in a professional fashion.\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player?

This is off the interview\": \"...miscommunication and things... Umm  but I feel like it ran really smoothly  um  because I had two co-chairs  and we all really worked together to keep things very organized  um  regimented to  like  keep after people...especially in the summer when everyone's all over the country  all over the world. Right? And you have to just keep emailing them  calling them if you can  um  checking up on them  but  you know? Finding a balance  you have to learn to trust the people that are under you  right? Um  and just make sure they have a good idea of what's going on  and they feel like they're playing an important role  because they are... Um  so that happened actually two weeks ago... the event...\", \"We tried to sell boba tea here  it was not a profitable operation but it was a fun activity\": \"It was so much fun! It was a little bit stressful as we got closer to the event...\", \"Fair enough  so thank you again for interviewing.\": \"...You know  things go wrong  and things go missing. Um... but I feel like I was able to stay very calm  and just  like  help people find alternatives if they...If  I don't know  if  like  a rehearsal time didn't work  or a designer wasn't showing up. Um  it was just best to find a very efficient  logical way to proceed.\", \"So  uh please tell me about your background.\": \"Uh  I would say that I'm a team player. Again  like even when in a leadership role  you're not just the one person doing the...\", \"Interesting. So  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"...thing. Um  I would say that being a team player applied to Cat Walk as well  but  um  for a different example  perhaps... I might return to  to product design  where we had to work in a smaller team of about  uh  there were five students and two mentors. Um  and we all came from different backgrounds  and none of us knew each other beforehand. We all had very different skill sets and very different personalities...\", \"So  uh do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict on a team that you were on and how you worked to resolve it?\": \"Um  so in the beginning  especially  we all had ideas that really clashed  and for the class  in a way that was good  because then we could come up with all these different ideas  and it's great...\", \"Mhmm. That makes sense. So if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"...Fair  I guess? In the way that we tried to distribute things? And when things got too heated  um  I feel like I especially served as kind of a mediator  calming people down and just  like  having them think about  y'know  what's practical  what are you actually able to get done? Um  what do you want to get done? 'Cause you want to make sure that people work on things that they're passionate about  um  so they can do their best work. Um  I feel like that's just a role that I play in a lot of team situations? Um  helping our team to find a balance so that we can work together most effectively...\", \"[laughs] \": \"Uh  for me  I would definitely try to (laughs) raise my own confidence level?

I think that when I'm in a team situation where there are very strong personalities  I tend to...I don't mind sharing my ideas  but then  as soon as I do  if it receives like a lot of criticism or...\", \"Sorry to hear that.\": \"...Some sort of  um  opposition  I'll tend to back down  um  and just kind of let it go and move forward on something else  but then sometimes those ideas  they turn out to be good ones  in the end and it's just like we kind of...\", \"A little more changeable note.\": \"...wasted time. Um  if only I had more solid arguments to go off of... So... I try to do a lot more planning on my own time. Um  so that I do have a solid foundation to go off if I don't get really scared or feel like the ideas I come up with are worthless  and I can't defend them...\", \"That's always very useful. So  uh  lastly  uh  now imagine you are applying for a job that you want  and you're-  maybe in the military maybe [?]. Why do you think you should get this job?\": \"I think I should get the job because...This position just sounds so ideal for me  um  it seems like a place  like a very collaborative environment? Where I can really call on different  uh  team members in the office itself  um  to just help me further my own ideas...

So the way I helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was I basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasn't showing up wasn't showing up  umm  and I basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with  mainly he wasn't showing up mainly because he felt he didn't like wasn't able to contribute enough  didn't know enough about the programs we were working with  so I basically sat there and talked him through it  helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it  so in that way he basically showed up a lot more  he was much more productive and useful to the team  and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically  and we avoided another problem of umm  basically  an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasn't doing his job.\", \" Hm.\": \"It's what it sounds like.  We try to make it more than boba tea  umm  currently we have primarily made boba tea  so its like  I think we've done like two or three events  and basically every time its like ok I'm gonna go to china town  get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca  bring it back  and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking  making large quantities of tea\", \" Hmm.\": \"My background is I grew up in Japan and wanted to go to M.I.T. to study aerospace engineering  wanted to fly for a very long time now.

It was probably my favorite activity  my favorite non-athletic activity that I did  and it was a little bit difficult to get participation  especially during busier times for school  because people would have so many other commitments to go to. So  in some of the committees we had  inside student government Junior  Senior year  there would just be not enough people for not even a quorum to be reached. So-\", \" Mm.  Certainly true for many people.  So  uh  think about the job you\\u2019d like to have \\u2013\": \"One thing about myself  hmm. [laughs] Well kind of as a joke right now  one thing definitely have a leg that's healed. \", \"- why do you think you should get this job?\": \"Um  but- \", \" Ah.  Well  thanks for sharing this all with me. \": \"I guess-\", \" Of course  it was great to meet -\": \"[laughs] Personality traits are something of that nature. [pause] Um  I think i can be a little bit more agr-  or not a little bit  a decently am-  a decent more-  a decent amount more agreeable. Sometimes  I certainly can have an opinion on a stance and once it's developed it's quite hard to change. I can dig my heels in when someone's kind of trying to argue the Congress. So  if I could be just a little more open minded and certainly more agreeable I think that would help me out in the long run.\", \"So  umm  tell me a little about your background.\": \"I think that I should be able to get this job because I have a lot to contribute to the company. I learn so much in my undergrad  and I've been wanting to apply that to a real-  to a tough problem  that has real uh  repercussions to the general public. And I've learned a lot of uh  theoretical knowledge on  on how to solve these problems. I've also learned a lot of practical things by being in projects  and working in groups  and  and learning how to handle a range-  or a multitude of different dynamics. \", \"Alright. So uhh  you think you're a leader. Tell me why.\": \"Um  I-  if-  if the team is working towards a goal  which I agree on  and this company certainly is-\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when you were on a team and there was a conflict you had to resolve it?\": \"I-  I'll put absolutely a hundred percent of effort into it  and work late  and-  and really try to get that goal  um  or really try to work towards that goal.\", \"If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" I'm Good.\", \"So now think of a job that you would like to have. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"I worked in the product-tech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development  for example  at Next Job and product management  for example  at Douche Ban  the German railway and Disney Parks and Resorts online.\", \"Well thanks for coming by.\": \"Sure. I think I..I am. Umm one example of that is I'm the president of Baker House-it's a dorm at MIT.\", \"So  uh  please tell me a bit about your background.\": \"Umm and as part of that I--there's about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year- about a fifty thousand dollar budget. Um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um  that there aren't conflicts between members of the team  that the umm other business of Baker House gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way that's good for the residents that are there.\", \"Ah  thank you. Uh  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Sure  so this sem-or this past summer at Disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones. So  we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones. \", \"OK  so let's talk a bit more about those groups. Uh  do you think you're a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you were on a team and you experienced a challenge. How did you resolve it?\": \"Sure. I think the..the one thing that I um you know  maybe I..I...maybe it's..it's a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at MIT it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than I do and umm you know  it's it's probably just you know  their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know  being able to do that would be good. \", \"Uh  thank you. So  can you tell me one thing that you would change about yourself if you could? If you had an option to change one thing?\": \"Uhh huh...\", \"Uh  thank you. And  uh  why do think you should get this job? Just think of a job you'd like to have.\": \"Yep..\", \"Hmm. Well  thank you.\": \"Mmm-hmm \", \"Uh-huh. \": \" Uh  fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in.  \\u2018Cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp [sic] in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature.  Uh  I think it worked pretty well.  Uh  it was definitely a system which could be used in future years.  Um \\u2013\", \"Uh-huh. Do you think you're a leader?\": \"No problem. \", \"Tell me why.\": \" Sure  um  [clears throat] sorry.  Uh  I am a junior in Computer Science here at MIT.\", \"Very good. Uh  do you think you're a team player? Give me an example of a time you were on a team  and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome that?\": \" I\\u2019m from [??]  Kentucky.  Uh  particularly interesting in  uh  consumer [??] products  um  front end development.  Um  I\\u2019ve had some experience doing both web development and some  uh  internal metrics testing and QA type of jobs.  So  that\\u2019s a little bit about my technical background.\", \"That's very good. So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \" Uh  people skills are very important.  I\\u2019ve been involved in many situations that  uh  involve both conflict resolution with people  involve organizing people towards a certain  a certain purpose or goal  which I think is  uh  very important  uh  quality of being a leader.  For example  um  previous  uh  work  uh  I\\u2019ve done with one of [??] organizations on campus  called Camp [??] of MIT  uh  we had a committee that  my  myself and my co-coordinator had a committee which we  we used to organize the unions for campers and  um  newsletters for  uh  families.  Uh  to give you more context with that  uh  my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization  which was a student camp  a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer \\u2013\", \"Yeah something  something that you need to improve upon. I vote to not being able to sleep as well  but unfortunately...\": \"- and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp.  So  that was my whole last year and I believe I was able to organize  uh  I believe pretty effectively.  Right now  I\\u2019m  uh  also a member of the MIT dance troupe  which  uh  is a dance group on campus.  And I\\u2019ve  uh  I\\u2019m choreog -   I\\u2019m a choreographer.  So  I\\u2019m organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester.  So  I think I can  uh  organize people pretty effectively and  uh  have a really good [??].\", \"Uh  I would like to teleport as well  but uh...\": \" Sure  okay.  Um  I think  dealing with  doing these\\u2026  Let\\u2019s go with  so  uh  the same organization  Camp [??] organization  last year as the coordinator for the  uh  families.  A big challenge for us was  uh  organizing our data.  Um  so  how that  so  essentially  what I mean by that is each  uh  family had to apply  uh  with their camper\\u2019s applications  but the applications itself are pretty  pretty heavy and require a lot of information  doctor\\u2019s records  medical records  and so people would send in their applications at different parts \\u2013\", \"Very good. That's a problem that afflicts us all. \": \"- uh  during the year.  Um  so they would never usually send in a full application.  So  keeping track of that  um  proved to be pretty  pretty challenging in itself.  Um  there were about three of us that they would send different parts to  uh  and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents.  So  uh  making sure that  uh  my team was communicating was important  very  very important.  In order to get through that \\u2013\", \"Uh  so do you have a job you'd like to have? Do you have in mind?\": \"- um  we decided to develop a  uh  sort of tool for  uh  organizing.  In the sense that \\u2013 \", \"Okay. So can you tell us why you deserve this job?\": \"- uh  whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct.\", \"Hum. \": \"- unfortunately  they switch to a different system  an online system  this year  so we don\\u2019t implement anymore.  That was a pretty solid system.  \", \"Oh well thank you. I appreciate you coming here today for this interview.\": \" Yeah.\", \"Well good.\": \" - um  wrist-taking.  Risk-taking is probably something I could  uh  work on.  Now  I don\\u2019t mean by risk-taking  taking risks just for the sake of risks  but being more open to  uh  trying something I\\u2019m not  uh  particularly  uh  familiar with or  uh  don\\u2019t know exactly what the outcome is going to be.  Uh  it\\u2019s definitely something I could  uh  give more thought towards.  I\\u2019m generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with  um  solutions that I can definitely plan out and foresee  but I understand that  especially in the real world there are times when  uh  you just don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s going to happen with  uh  later down the line and decisions have to be made.  So  keeping that in mind  um  knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of  uh  going down a certain path to a solution is something I could  uh  I\\u2019d  uh  I\\u2019d like to change about myself.  \", \"Ahaha  I understand. So  uh  please tell me a bit about your background.\": \" Mm.\", \"Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Um  For -- One of the resources  if I may say so  which had to be shared in  in our team was myself  because I ha--\", \"Mhm. Very good. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you tell me about a time of you were on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you go about resolving that challenge?\": \" No problem.  Thanks for having me.  \", \"If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"It's been a tough week.\", \"That's an interesting thought  thank you. So now  uh  think of a job that you'd like to have. Do you have one in mind?\": \"Yeah  I think so  I think  I think I have umm  I have a talent for being able to identify what motivates people  and in organizations it's very easy to  you know  get caught up in what's perceived to be  you know? Everyone's common motive that the companies supposed to be about. And although the ideal framework would be nice if everyone was working indeed towards the same goal  in reality  sometimes  you know different agents  different people in the company  different people in the group have different  you know  slightly different goals for they're in the game in the first place. And I think by being able to recognize these individual motives and being able to marshal them  instead of being a destructive force towards the company  being able to marshal everyone's individual talents or desires  umm  as a force that can be used to benefit the company  I think this sort of  you know  deeper  deeper attention to what people want is what  we- wha- wha- what basically makes me be able to be a  you know  a good leader by being able to take all the resources that are provided by the team and use the parts to make a good whole sum.\", \"Mhm. Well thank you.\": \"If I were to change one- one thing about myself it would umm  it would probably have to be... I guess  being umm  being more mindful of my time and being a little more meticulous to make sure that all those  you know  unaccounted for minutes that past by over the course of the day  uhh  don't add up  you know? Into large chunks of time that are being unused. I wish I had a better sense of realizing quickly when my time is not being used optimally  and freedom to actually correct that.\", \"So  please tell me about your background.\": \"So  I  I think that for most jobs and this one as well in a very quantitative field  which does also involve  you know  leading a team of different people from various backgrounds  I think that I would be  you know  uniquely skilled for this job  because I do have a strong technical background while I can also take different parts of a team  and bring together people with  you know  they have different motives initially  into a coherent unit to get a job done.\", \"Oh  that's all very cool. Thank you. So  uh  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Thank you very much.\", \"Ah  that's excellent. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"So  I'm a math major at MIT. I'm a junior. Um  specifically study  uh  Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Uh  I have a focus on statistics and algorithms.\", \"Ah  that's all very good. Uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?\": \"Um  so I  I think I am a team player. Um  I have a pretty diverse background as far as  um  CS and math-related kinda things go and so  um  I'm pretty good at working with different  uh  people from different backgrounds. Specifically in those fields  uh  also in other fields. Um  I think the particular challenge with that is being able to communicate to  uh  team members your  your ideas if  uh  they're not exactly familiar with them.\", \"Mhmm. Yes.\": \"Sure. So  I think one thing that I certainly don't like is that I tend to be very nervous. Um  especially when speaking in front of  uh  large groups of people. And  I think definitely if I could avoid that problem  it's certainly be good. Um  one of the things because you're always given the opportunity to talk in front of people and it's  uh  whether you're presenting work or you're socializing or something  meeting new people. It's always something that you have to deal with and  you know  being being very sociable or being around a lot of people is certainly very helpful.\", \"There's always more that we can learn.\": \"Um  so  I think one of the reasons is that I enjoy a good challenge. Um  and I enjoy very challenging problems which I know that your company certainly offers. Um  another reason is the  my  my interests are very aligned with the company's interests  and I think that  um  both could benefit from learning  uh  especially myself  from your company and the people I work with.\", \"Well thank you!\": \"And I'll be graduating [??]\", \"How are ya?\": \"Yeah. \", \"Ah  good. So  please tell me about your background.\": \"Uh  to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative  and like creates a vision when they're given a blank slate. Uh  when  when I think somebody is a leader they  they don't have to be told what's done  or what needs to get done. And they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three  and make a decision. And also like get other people excited about it and organized.\", \"Excellent. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"ink  whereas um I didn't necessarily think it was that. And so you know we took a couple of minutes just to stand back and kind of you know   consider all of the possibilities. And um we ended up having to ask the patient like a couple of other questions. Um. And what we ultimately found out was that he had a history of anxiety.\", \"Hmm  that makes sense. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example when there was a conflict in a team that you were on  and how you had to resolve it?\": \"We had to ah  my group was in charge of analysing the materials  and we  of the section that I got asigned was  was ah  within our team we did like a self ah  splitting it up. And I got like a way way heavy load  and somebodies got to really like move. So it was like pretty  I didn't know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that. And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team. Then we're going to have to be on the same page. So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly. \", \"Ah  very good. So uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself   what would that be? And why?\": \"To never have to sleep. Like realistically? Is this like ah...\", \"That makes a lot of sense. So  uh  now think of a job that you'd like to have.\": \"Not going to answer things like that. \", \"Cool. So  uh  why do you think you should get this job?\": \"Yeah.\", \"Well thank you for coming. I appreciate you coming for this interview.\": \"I do.\", \" Please tell me a bit about your background.\": \"Uh  cause I work well with other groups  and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things. \", \"Okay.  Welcome.  So  uh  do you think you're a leader.  Tell me why.\": \"And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative  but it's not like bureaucratic. \", \"Very good.  Do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a conflict that you experienced on a team and how you resolved it?\": \"So  so this is like the perfect environment  and uh  and I have like some experience in the area. But more importantly like I  I figure things out and get them done. Like as they need to be  so people don't have to tell me what to do  or watch over me and stuff like that. Like it's  if I want something to be accomplished like we'll work with a team to get it done. Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever. \", \"Good.  I imagine that would have been a very difficult situation.  \": \"Yup.\", \"It was pretty tough.\": \"Good.\", \" So  now thinking about a job you'd like to have.  Okay  you have one in mind?\": \"Uhm  my name is <inaudible> I am Junior in course 20. Which is Biological Engineering. I come from Puerto Rico. And... I've been learning a bit more this past year about what I actually want to do in life. Right now my main goals are set more towards the medicine side of Bioengineering. So medical devices  biomaterials  tissue engineering  drug delivery  it's what  it's what interests me right now. Uh... it's not set right now that's why I am also tending to go to different research opportunities and different uh... pharmaceutical internships and we'll see what happens from there on. And I'll be able to focus on one actual path per say. \", \"The one you interview for.  So  why do you think you should have this job?\": \"So... I think I am leader because I like planning things. I like to gather all the information I have  all the resources I have  and all the uh... basically either group uh... all the group <inaudible> or each contribution from each person  gather them all up and come up with an efficient plan to tackle said problem  or homework  or project  or presentation. Whichever may be the case. I tend to make people give more than... I make them give more than 100% of what the  they  they  the bar that they set themselves at. So I feel if I feel that somebody has potential I can notice it and at the same time work with a person to basically exploit that potential to a new maximum. At the same way I feel that I am very open to constructive criticism  if somebody feels that I am not doing a great job I am very happy just to sit with them and learn from that experience because it's gonna make me more efficient in the future. So I feel that just having a set plan from the start to tackle problems  and at the same way editing it and adapting it to every new situation or the feelings of the people you are basically  uh overseeing then that's  uh  a very good approach to everything that we do. \", \"Well thank you.  Appreciate your coming in to interview today.\": \"So  uh  teams have been uh very large aspect of my life. Ever since High School I've been a part of the Soccer team. I continue to do that now. I've been part of the debate team  and Honor Society which had it's own team for competitions. But I feel that the biggest challenge right now has been when I am with a team of people that are seniors to me. So they  they are better prepared  much better informed  and have an arsenal of skills that I have yet to acquire because I just don't have the same level of experience that they have. So if I am Sophomore  and I've been grouped with Seniors and Juniors of my subject of Engineering class  the difference is very noticeable. The difference of level and performance is very noticeable. And I try to  basically  give what I can  but I also want to excel at what I can actually move forward to. So if I feel that I can actually contribute much more than what they're expecting of me  because if I don't have that level of experience what I want to do is get to that level. So I gotta work harder  push through and get to this level that's basically at the same level as the rest of the group. So I'll try to work with people  and I'll try to find someone who mentor me through that process. And step by step  because the biggest challenge for me  is being alone and tackling it straight  I'll use the other group members  I'll readily approach them and ask for help because that's what the group is for. The team succeeds together all the way. So... that's I go.\", \"Good  tell me more about your backround.\": \"The first one that pops right into mind is... Bioengineering.\", \"mhmm.\": \"So I've always been naturally curious about things. I've always had  a drive behind everything I do  so I got into Bioengineering right after I saw that I had this opportunity coming to MIT  and coming from a family that has been effected by a lot of cancer  I found that doing this I could actually benefit my family  benefit other people's families that have been effected by it. I've been going through some really tough times with grandmothers  and other family members that have survived and succumbed to it. And from there my motivation has been always to push forward no matter what the challenge. So when I step into a lab  I see what I have in front of me  the ultimate goal might be the farthest goal in my life  I may never reach it but rest assured that I will do my best to contribute to its forward movement. I will always try and leave it at a better place than it was before  and if I am not the one to reach it  another person will but I will be sure that I actually contributed to it.\", \"mmhm. That's great. Could I get you to scoot over a little bit? \": \"Alright so  my background  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and  umm  I've also done research in the computer science field. Umm  I interned  er  I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to  uh  to teach. And I've also had some experience  uh  internship at  uh  at Google.\", \"left  there you go. Uhm  Do you think you're a leader? tell me why.\": \"I think I'm a leader. I do believe I have leadership  uh  qualities and that  and I can support this because I've been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus. And when I have had the responsibilities I've carried them out  uh  very well and I've been able to overcome challenges such as umm  one of the groups I'm  uh  on the executive board of expedited access to standard education. Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group. And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past.\", \"Okay  and do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?\": \"Oh  well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh  my participation in my team in are student association\", \"that's uh. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish  I was in charge and I thought I'd give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set  so  um  as leader to be responsible for that task  I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students' lives because I was getting context and uh  understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didn't have a lot of tests or homework that week. And through that  ahem  through that understanding I was able to  um  help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict.\", \"Great  and why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"One thing about myself. Interesting. If I was given the option to change one thing about myself  yes?\", \"OK Tell me a bit about your background\": \"Well I think I should get the job because I  um  have the skills necessary to complete the  the task that I'll be assigned. Um I'm very motivated  I'm always willing to learn and I  I'm very passionate about learning and uh  I think I'll be able to learn a lot through the position  as well as contribute to the position and be able to  um  influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project.\", \"Great. And do you think you are a leader  and why?\": \"Very well  thanks.\", \"And do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it?\": \"My background...uh  I have a fiarly technical background. I went to a fairly technical high school. Um  I have mainly a mathematics and physics background with also some computer science. Uh  I also  I have been involved in leadership  uh  outside of  outside of academics. So then in high school I was  uh  captain of my chess team  and I also served as president of a couple of clubs in high school. So I have some  some experience in that regard. Like I said  mainly I have a pretty quantitative technical background and  uh  with some sprinkling of other stuff as well.\", \"And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Yes  I think so  because I typically think using my own mind and I act on those decisions rather than listening to what...uh  I mean  of course  I take into account what... I think it was Lincoln who said that  uh  you should take into account what people tell you but then make your own decision. He said it more elaborately  but those are the essence of what he was saying  and I try to  I try to  to use that in every day life and in  also in  like important projects. I would say that  and I  I usually have  I'm usually pretty successful in convincing people that my way is right when it is.\", \"And why do you think you should get the job\": \"Um  yeah  I think so. Uh  when its a matter of ideology I don't like to make compromises  but when it's a matter of  uh  getting stuff done  I think that I  I think that I am a team player. I think that uh  usually I'm   I'm willing to  to make sacrifices if necessary for the ultimate goal. And so  for example  uh  one time in high school  uh  we had a group project  and one of the member  I mean  it was more complicated than I'm making it  but the gist of it was that one of the members who was responsible for our data analysis  he fell short  he  uh  he  we found out pretty late  uh  just a few days before the presentation  that he had misdone most of the data analysis  and as a result  the rest of us  but especially me  because it was a group of four  and we were kind of divided into two  him and me  and then subdivided into ones. So he and I were kind of a subgroup of a larger group. And so I was more responsible for what he had done than the other two were. So it was mainly me  with some help from the other two. We had to put in a lot of work in those last few days  especially me. I had to fix that and try to get it  you know  get it functional before the presentation was due.\", \"I'm doing well  um  tell me more about your background.\": \"ok\", \"Okay. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \" I do think I'm a leader in some regards.  I mean  it's important to not always  and sometimes you don't want to be a leader.  Um  it's important to know how to follow as well  but I think  umm  I am  like  in most situations  a leader.  For example  I was  uh  sort of like  the leader for my 212 Intro to Robotics group  where we build a robot  amongst the four of us  four to five.  Uhh  my group happened to be four.  We built a robot.  I sort of lead the group:  organizing meetings  uhh  delegating tasks  making sure that everyone was doing  uhh  what they were meant to  and just getting everyone on the same page.  So just instances like that  I think  have shaped me into being a leader.\", \"Alright. And do you consider a team player? Can you give me an example if there was a conflict in your team  and your aim to resolve it?\": \"Um  well Im from Florida.  I was born in Miami.  My  uh  parents are from...I'm  uh  South Korean by ethnicity.  I'd say I'm more American by heritage but uh  my  um  parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down.  And around  I was born  like around 90s I was born here in Florida.  I had all my schooling in Florida.  I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated.  That's a brief synopsis of my background.\", \"Okay. And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"I think I am  uh  just because  um  I have seniority maybe through sports or if it's from...I feel like it's hard for people not to be leaders especially when you're um  assigned to do group work or you're assigned to do goal setting.  I feel like if you're in any  uh  situation where you're doing goal setting you're being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them.  And how you tell  like  you're telling yourself  How am I gonna get this done.  So like  basically you're self leading.  I believe.  Um  maybe I'd say through sports I was probably a leader.  By  um  me being the upperclassman  I led my teammates on.  So I'd say  yeah  I've been a leader.\", \"I see. And why do you think you should get into Medical School?\": \" Uh  yes  um.  SO  seeing how I rowed four years  I think the biggest conflict was um  when  um  Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals.  ANd the last  pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals. That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing  especially because that's something I spent four hours a day  six days a week on for my entire senior  um  high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college.  And what really um  made me realize was that yes  like  that was a big mistake  it was just  honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it weren't for some people  if it weren't for just me  just being  just taking and it and just maturing from it  I think that's like  what it takes.  If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it.  You can still push something onto the table.  Like  um  last  last (?) year and still work hard to  to really fight through it.  You can really become great.  And um  I feel like that's what I was really working to change my view on that and um  in the end we  um  we medaled  we  uh  were runner ups in states.  We medaled.  So  I think that was a  good  good conflict that I resolved.\", \"How you doing today?\": \"I wish  I wish...If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being  I think  more proactive to do something.  I'd say  I wish I was more...I wish I was could  I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose  actually.  Because I feel like um  I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering  like  I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different  more than one thing.  I know  I know like it's good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field.  But I always wondered  I always wondered like  what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um  club activities.  That way I could have like  a more well-rounded high school experience.\", \"Good.  Tell me more about your background.\": \" after being able to shadow uhm a neonatologist in high school  I think that's when I kind of figured  this  like i want to work in pediatrics  and plus I love kids as well. That's when I really figured out that's \", \" Great! Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Well  I think I should have this job mainly because I find that I'm well with groups  I work very well with groups.  At the same time when you push me to do tasks myself I'm able to do the same amount  be just as productive.  I feel like  um  as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work  um  there should be no difference in how I should produce something in group work in individual work.  I should be just as creative and innovative if I was working myself or if I was spending time working with a group of people.  So  I feel like if I was going to get this job  um  it would help greatly for the people I'd be working with and for myself.  \", \"Great!  Do you consider yourself a team player?

Um so together we delegated work  and so one person had to do this  um  reach out to them and one person had to do that and i was def a big part of taking in whatever  everything that we had to do and like trying to make sure everyone had something in order to not let this really important part of our work would be lost. \", \"Great!

So freshman year I did some work  um  at the Department of Energy  um  working the CFO's office so I'm getting kind of a feel for the budget um also risk matrices. Then I kinda branched more towards CS aspects  so  I did a bit of coding here and there in most research aspects and also  um  for companies.\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Yeah  soum  last winter I was working in the Boston area at Autotegrity which is like a online marketing start up. um   I don't know how much familiarity you have with  um  coding like repository systems  but  basically if someone  um  uploads like their work to the server and it doesn't work basically everyone elses stuff doesn't work either. So there's like a little column button type thing in rebuild which is called the blame button so you could kind of blame people. So every once in a while it would occur where someone would screw up the code and that would make everyone's work stop instead of you know blaming the one person telling them to fix the code we would all kind of look at where it went wrong and how we could improve upon that further instead of just fixing one persons code. So it was kind of a group effort to see how much we could all improve from the one mistake. \", \"Alright. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"I guess I would probably try to ask more questions. Um  in general if I get directions which are really broad where I don't know where to start searching um instead of asking my higher up i would probably just automatically start looking at everything and start floating around. I guess it would be good to get more like to the point.\", \"In terms of anything.\": \"Um like I mentioned before i think I have a good combination of leadership skills as well as um team player abilities. In addition to this I am pretty qualified I believe in terms of my academic classes that I have taken and also my extracurriculars have demonstrated I have a deep passion for math.

Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus. And um  so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it  but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event. Um  a lot of the girls that came to the dinner  um  who are now freshmen  still say  Oh I remember you from (unintelligible). It was a really good feeling to get through that.\", \"Good. Umm  tell me more about your background. We never met before.\": \"Um  I'm currently a junior at MIT studying Biology.

We have a pre-med advising office  but  um  most students at MIT end up going into like  Engineering or Research  not very many go into medicine. So  um  we provide a lot of  um  outside activities for pre-meds. Uh  our main one is  um  lecture series  so we often ask Doctors from nearby hospitals to come speak about  like  what they do.\", \"umm\\u2019hua\": \"I'm currently a Junior here at MIT and I'm pursing a double major in Computer Science and Management um the reason for that is that I actually fell in love with um the merging of computer science with a lot of other fields and I found that management is a way to take computer science and the theories of algorithms and problem solving and taking it to a wider field which is exactly why I'm interested in consulting is again its the idea of taking problem solving and algorithms and applying it to a lot of different problems and always trying new things and I'm very excited about that and that's where I'm coming from\", \"O that\\u2019s great. Ok. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" I do.  Um  I'm actually a part of the Gordan Engineering leadership program here at MIT  which students are chosen through an application  process to be a part of this program  and in this program um  we work on engineering leadership labs which is um  they give us scenarios which we might encounter in the real world and we take the position of a leader and kind of get to step through it  and I've gotten very positive feedback from my group every time about how I've handled those.  In addition  in um various activities I'm involved in on campus I have had a leadership role in many of those and again I've gotten very positive feedback from the people I've worked with so I think those put together mean not only have I had the experience to be a leader but I've also had positive feedback that I am succeeding at that.\", \"Great. And\\u2026 why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Definitely!  Um  I was on the committee that designed our class ring so at MIT each year there's a new class ring designed specifically for that year and the idea is that it enco..encompasses aspects of all different fractions of student life so this committee is made up of a very diverse group of people.  And um  there were some features on the ring which we would become very divided on and there few ah divisions within campus which kind of became clear on our team  so people would kind of polarize based on which side of the campus fraction they lived on and then it would kind of get a little bit hostile  and people would say this is relevant  no it's not relevant  um and I kind of became the peace keeper um where I would kind of go between those sides try to find the mutually agreeable thing maybe like if someone really wanted something on the ring and someone else didn't I would suggest maybe we could make it smaller or have it somewhere else so if it was on the ring but not so blatantly obvious that the people who didn't relate to it thought it was too focal  so I became kind of the unofficial go between who would hear both sides kind of impartially and put things together...and I had about 2 to 3 people afterwards tell me that we wouldn't have gotten to where we did without my peacekeeping.\", \"Okay. Do you think you are a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Yes  I believe I\\u2019m a leader.  Right now  um  one of my main leadership initiatives is restarting the Society of Naval Architects Submarine Engineers at MIT.  And that\\u2019s a group of all the ocean engineers studying at MIT including undergrads and grad-students.  And  um  I\\u2019m working with other students to organize dinners with professors and outings with  with students interested in engineering from other schools and departments.\", \"Okay. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me a example of a time where there was a conflict in your team and you had to solve it? \": \"Yes  I\\u2019d say I\\u2019m a team player.  Uhm  this  this term I\\u2019m working on a team for one of my classes. A team of about seven people and we\\u2019re building  er  manufacturing a hundred yo-yos together and  um  it\\u2019s actually complicated to manufacture one yo-yo if you\\u2019re doing everything from scratch like the molds  the plastic  the process times  you figuring out which missions you want to use.  And  um  we\\u2019ve done a yo-yo  we decided to divide our team into  um  groups of two people and each set of two people works on one part of the yo-yo so we have four parts.  And we were having a problem just last week when we needed to fill out a report about our yo-yos but two teams hadn\\u2019t finished their part yet because they couldn\\u2019t  um  get time in the mission shop  so we decided to resolve that by  we talked to the professor  I was the person who talked to the professor and asked for an extension on the report and told him what was happening.  Uhm  we got the extention  and anyway  if we wrote the report except missing the information from those two parts and then  the team working on those two parts is going to fill it in this week.\", \"Oh. Okay.\": \"Let\\u2019s see.  Sometimes  I would like to be more comfortable with my voice.  Like speaking louder and more confidently.  \", \"Great. If you had the option to change on thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Sometimes  like when I go back home I pick up this southern accent again.  My family lives in D.C.  but a lot are from the south and they speak with the twang so when I came home for Thanksgiving I had this southern twang.  Oh  it sounded different and people were a little bit confused and then I went into this middle stage  now I\\u2019m back to where I am now.  Maybe speaking a little bit more quieter  but without the accent.  So I need to find out where my voice is.  \", \"Okay. And why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"Uhm  I am a really hard worker  I\\u2019m very organized  I\\u2019m comfortable working with teams.  I\\u2019m also on a sealing team which is another part of a team that I\\u2019m involved on.  Um  I\\u2019m passionate about what I do and I can bring a lot of engineering expertise and knowledge into the group.\", \"Ok!  It's nice to walk in from the <unintelligible>.\": \"Yes. Because  umm  everything I try to do  I  you know  always try to do the best that I can  and  even if I'm not the best at it  that-- the effort  like that alone should be enough to sort of inspire somebody  even if they're better at it than I am  you know. I find that's inspiring  you know  seeing someone try  you know  and trying their hardest. And maybe they're not the best at it but  you know  the effort that they put into something  is sort of something to be looked high upon  so...\", \"Yeah  same here!  So  uh  why don't you tell me a little bit about your background?\": \"*hushed laughter* Umm  sure. Sooo  basically almost every night when you go home to problem set... You know  problems sets here are sort of designed to be group efforts  at least in chemical engineering they are  and often you and your group are working and you come to a crossroads  you know  part of the group thinks you should go one wan and part of the gorup things we should go another way. And  you know  kind of something that I've learned is that you can't shut down other people's ideas... Umm  so  I think something really important to do is... WE end up trying both ways  and maybe it takes us a little blt more effot  and maybe it takes us a little bit longer  but then we know for sure  like  you know  Okay  this way definitely didn't work  and you know maybe this way is the better way to go... but at least we didn't just  you know  diverge one way  and think like Oh  maybe we should have done it another way  so I think that's pretty important.\", \"Huh.  Well good!  Do you think you're a leader?  Tell me why!\": \"Umm  hmmm. I wish I was taller *both laugh*. You know  sometimes  I guess I always think that  you know  I'm right  and  you know  it takes people some convincing and I--I know I'm definitely not right all the time but I think that's kind of  you know  like  human nature  like  no-one ever wants to think that they're wrong   but  uhh  you know something I've learned here is \", \"That makes sense.  Sometimes you lead  sometimes you follow.  Do you consider yourself a team player?\": \"Heh  ha  because I've been working my but off *both laugh* Umm  you know  it's just something that I'm very passionate about. I'm really  not... I would do it for free  like I'm  you know people say they want to do medicine for the money  or you know  'cause it's a high-power career  but you know   it's the only type of thing... and... that I see myself being satisfied with in a long-term career. It's... I love being part of  like  the medical community right now  you know  if it's my work between being an EMT  working at the hospital... you know  working as a tech... These are all things that I would love and I would do. I'm happy to wake up in the morning and go do these things  and  you know  I wanna say it's like my burning passion like  it is  you know  my drive and  you know  I think that's probably the most important thing when you're looking for a candidate for medical school or for a job. Umm  it's knowing that  you know  they're not gonna  you know  one day decide that they don't wanna do this anymore  and they're not kind of like Yeah  I'm not sure if I wanna go to med school. It's like  no  I've been wanting to do this since I was like  nine years old  and every single thing I've done to work my way towards it... it's just made me fall in love with it even more.\", \"Could you give me an example of a time you were on a team and you faced a challenge?\": \"Um  so  I was born in Japan  um  where I lived for seven years. After that  I moved to uh the U.S. when I was around seven or eight years old. Uh  first to Michigan for a couple of years  from two to three  and then to Maryland um and it was in Maryland that I started middle school. And  it was through middle school and high school that I was exposed to above average and advanced courses in science  math  and uh programming. I was competing with I think the best in the state  and probably best in the nation  taking math competitions  just doing a lot of science competitions in general. Um  junior year of high school  uh  because of peer and parental pressures  I decided to go into premed. And I decided to take  consequently decided to take some bio classes  uh  a lot of cell physiology  genetics  psychology. And when I got here at MIT  uh well logically I decided to major in course twenty  bio engineering. Um  and to just to follow that track I decided to take a couple  decided to do a couple internships in labs  four labs actually  two in academia here at MIT actually and I realized that uh the positions weren't fast paced and weren't competitive enough or quantitative enough for that matter  so I decided to go into industry hoping that would satisfy my requirements  I guess. And again it was fun  I learned a lot  but it was just uh it didn't have the skill set requirements that I wanted. Uh but it was um my last internship I had the opportunity to talk with several directors  managers  people on the business side  I realized that could be something that I want to do. That could be more appropriate for me  for my career. Um  afterward I talked to a lot of my finance colleagues  started taking finance classes  went to workshops  started networking  and I realized  you know  this is most likely what I want to do. I talked to several people who wanted to go into trading and they gave me some interview questions and I said you know what  that's exactly the kind of questions that I want to tackle on a daily basis. And so that's why I'm here.\", \"And you solved it\": \"Do I think I'm a leader? I believe so. And this is  I say so because of several reasons. One is from  just from personal experience in the past. I've uh worked in teams  Ive met teams  a few in high school and a few in college  and I think I work well with others. But not only that  people trust me. I am able to divide up a huge project  break it down into small sub-projects and uh give  assign these tasks to different people without uh any complaints  without too much complaints. I think I have some leaderships skills  uh as you can see from my resume if (inaudible mumbling).\", \"Ah  that's good to hear.  So  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"I do consider myself a team player. I'd like to give a good example. In my sophomore year in high school  I worked with this project called Mission Impossible  or Mission Possible  sorry  and the goal of the project was to design a rover from scratch  that would traverse a platform and record data  send it over to the computer  and the computer will create a 3D graph  a 3D replica of the terrain. And we were graded on how precise and accurate  how similar the 3D terrain was to the actual terrain. And there were many parts to the project  one was the construction of the actual rover. The other was the programming. Making us write the source code. Third one was making the terrain. The forth one was integrating everything together. There were five group members  there were only four tasks. I was picked to be  I guess the group leader  so I assigned the tasks. I made sure everything integrated correctly. And  it's not a small task  but uh  it definitely gave me some experience. I think one of the problems was  because this was a four week long project  this was a four week long project  but we didn't get much done until the third or forth week  because things just didn't integrate correctly. There weren't communications  there weren't assigned tasks  there just wasn't teamwork. There just wasn't the synergy that was required for us in order for us to finish this project. And during the third week I was appointed the captain  I gave tasks. I made sure every part was compatible. I made sure that everybody knew what everybody else was doing  and in the end we completed the project successfully.\", \"Mhm!\": \"Well  as you can see from my resume  my biggest weakness I think is my lack of formal training in finance. Uh  I'm not a course fifteen finance or management major  or a course fourteen economics major. I don't have any form of work experience  I don't work in a big bank or investment company or a proprietary trading firm. But  I can tell you  that I have taken more initiative  I've been more proactive in the last year in terms of looking for ways to combat  to overcome my weakness. I've gone to network sessions  I've actually set up to quit my sports team so I could go to these network sections  info sessions  workshops  because unfortunately team practice was always between five and seven and that was also the period in which info sessions were held. I did my research  I've gone online and went to your company website  I know exactly who you guys and what you're looking for  I know exactly what my role will be. I don't have any false expectations about my job. And  after knowing everything  I am still very very very interested in the position.\", \"So think of a job that you'd like to have.\": \"Well  I  I think my answer to the past question about uh how I overcame at my weakness how one of my strength is  my quantitative competitive and fast paced abilities  and the fact that I don't have any false expectations  I know exactly what I want to do  I know exactly what you want from me. And  those are very good reasons  like they apply to this. And I would also like to compare myself with the rest competition and tell you that I have more  I don't think there's anybody else with the same kind of technical strength  technical expertise that I have  um  even uh most students here at MIT.\", \"So why do you think you should have the job?\": \"Good! How are you?\", \"Well thank you!  This concludes the interview.\": \"Um  so  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and molecular biology. Um  most of my background is in biology. I did research for about a year and a half at a lab here at MIT  in just basic molecular biology. Um  but  I'm also involved in a couple student groups on campus. One of them  I was previously involved in MIT Fighting World Hunger  so we did a lot of charity work with local and international hunger issues and trying to learn more about the issues. And  right now I've devoted all of my time to a different organization called GlobeMed at MIT  and we basically  our partner is a nonprofit organization abroad and we do work to improve HIV healthcare services in Togo  which is in Africa. Most people don't know where that is  so.\", \"So  um  please tell me about your background.\": \"I think  uh  if I'm not now I think I have the potential to be one. Um  I still consider myself immature as in  I'm still a student  but  I think I have been given a couple of leadership positions that I've grown a lot from  um  and I think if I was given  if I was put in a different situation I could adapt to it. Um  would you like an example of a...\", \"Hmm\": \"Um  so  uh  I'm co-president of the organization I just mentioned  GlobeMed at MIT. And  we  uh  basically are in charge  me and my fellow co-president are in charge of about 30 other members. Um  and this involves a lot of coordination among teams that we have split. We've organized our organization into different teams and we've got like campaigns  which is like fundraising team  and we've got communications  is like publicity  finances  and community building  and these are all like split up  at the same time we also have to maintain contact with our partner organization abroad in Togo. Um  so we do a lot with like non-profit business as well as marketing but also sort of try to appeal to the undergraduate population in terms of fundraising but also awareness. So it's kind of  pretty multi faceted  I think I've done a lot in terms of building up this organization  it started from scratch essentially  so. And  if you wanted examples of leaderships I guess I could... the only objective thing would be like what we've accomplished so far  would that be interesting to you?\", \"Oh  great. So uh  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.\": \"Um  so  uh  so we started this year essentially  and we were able to secure a lot of sponsorships from different companies such as City Sports  Dunkin Donuts  Copy Tech  as well as MIT sponsorships like the public service center  where they would give us about $3000 to do our project in January in Togo. And  an MIT office donated 62 laptops just this last week. So I think  like  we've been definitely doing well like getting our name out there and also  um  achieving what we've set out to do  which is improve healthcare. Um  well  the project hasn't essentially started but our mission was to provide technology to improve clinical efficiency there. So  um  having our first step sort of been made by securing these donations I think is a good step of us showing that we have been succeeding objectively  but  but yeah.\", \"Ah  yes. So uh  do you think you're a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge? How did you go about resolving it?\": \"Um  yes  so  I do think I've definitely learned a lot from this experiment  experience  to become more of a team player. And I think I  uh  I know what it takes to be a good team player  by seeing what doesn't work  what does work  qualities that I don't think work in other members in interactions that I've had. So  an example would be  uh  last year  when GlobeMed first started  I wasn't the co-president  but we had a set of co-presidents who were also starting out. So  to be fair  it was a totally new concept  new organization  and it's  their downfall is they weren't that motivated. They didn't really seem to care that much about the outcome of our organization. And for me and other members that really devoted ourselves to it  it really frustrated us  um  but we had to learn how to be team players in the sense that we couldn't just go out and do everything ourselves and risk stepping on their toes. We had to respect their position as our bosses essentially. And this definitely was difficult in a lot of ways  I think I learned that you have to know your bounds and know that you can't achieve everything. You can't always just brute force your way through things. I think that  um  it's always the best way  if you ever feel like any conflict is about to arise or if you feel uncomfortable at something  like  immediately schedule a time to meet with that person  just talk it out  completely respectfully  without approaching a bunch of people and asking what they think. It's just probably better to meet face to face with that person and settle it from the start. And then you know if things don't improve after that  there may be other things you can do involving other members  but I think it's best  just face to face  yeah  so much of our world is like by e-mail nowadays  so yeah.\", \"(snickers)\": \"Oh. Hm. Well  my joke would be I wish I was taller  but  hahaha. Well  I wish I was more  I guess I would change  my  like  time management skills. Because I think I definitely am not as efficient as I'd like to be right now  especially as a student. Um  I think I spend a lot of time on Facebook. I do a lot of networking  which I think I justify to myself like 'Oh that's good for future endeavors ' but I really think I  like  I could be more efficient in terms of like  you know my free time in the summer  like  learn a new programming language. Like  that could be  that's always something I wanted to do but never end up doing. So  so yeah  I would probably change that.\", \"Oh  good. So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what do you think that would be?\": \"Uh  I think I'm very like motivated. I think because I know how to act as a leader of a group. I may not be the most experienced in software development since I just started the major. I think I can direct a team of people very diverse from me and working very different from me because I think I'm a very vocal person. I think I communicate well  uh  with people  or attemptfully. And I think that can be useful when it's a team. And  I think software development  like a lot of people think  like  it's just one person in a group programming  but I think it really involves a lot of coordination among the team. I think I can contribute that way.\", \"Mmmh.\": \"\\u201cLaughs\\u201d O ok. Umm. My name is Victoria Mcray (sp) and I\\u2019m an Aerospace Engineer at MIT. I am a Junior and I\\u2019m in NRTC (sp) witch is a Naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer. \", \"Interesting. Em  so  and now  think of a job that you'd like to have. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Umm  last semester I was a squad leader in ROTC\\u2026\", \"Hmm.  Ah  well thank you for coming here today.\": \"Which is dependent on upon  umm  our PT scores which we have competitive\\u2026 PT being Physical Training  umm\\u2026\", \"tell me about your background.\": \"\\u2026we have different physical competitions each week. We also have  Naval Knowledge quizzes  etcetera  in working together. Umm  and we had  sometimes  the freshman are a little  umm  getting use to it a little slower  in to getting to the\\u2026\", \"[laughter]\": \"\\u2026ended up doing a lot better towards the end.\", \"Oh...\": \"\", \"Well good. Glad to hear you're uh getting to enjoy the city. So uh do you think you're a leader? Can you tell me why?\": \"My command presence. Meaning  umm  sometimes I\\u2019m more quite  and its something I think it over and not be as shy about when I talk to others and to feel confident when I know something. Umm  in order to fix this I often put myself out there and try and \\u201ccoughs\\u201d not hide in the corner. \", \"Well good. So um do you consider yourself to be a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when you worked in a team and encountered some sort of a challenge? How did you go about resolving it?\": \"I'm good.\", \"not to mention. If I give you an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be ?\": \"Yeah  and so  yeah  so when I was after high school  I decided to apply to colleges in the U.S. Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future.\", \"Think of a job you would like to have. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"So  yep  applied to a couple of different schools. Um. Choosing  ending up choosing MIT.\", \"Thank you for interviewing with us today.\": \"Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader. Um that said  I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things. Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture. I think using that while I don't necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that. In that respect  I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner.\", \"Can you tell me a little bit about your background?\": \"Absolutely  yeah  I definitely do consider myself a team player. And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus. And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that there's there's usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew. And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains. And so we didn't know anything about this patient until we got there. Um. But when we did  um mostly the crew chief  the person above me  and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem. And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem.\", \"Yes very good. So uh  are you a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge? How did you go about solving it?\": \"So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem. And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line.\", \"That's very excellent. So uh  what's your greatest weakness? If you had to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"Um. If I had the option to change one thing about myself. Um. I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident. Um. Mostly as a speaker  I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people. Um and I have worked on that. Um. Both as an EMT  you know  you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more. Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus. Um such as I'm leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students. So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus  I've definitely had to I've definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people.\", \"So  think of a job you'd like to have.\": \"hink that ultimately that would help a great deal as for me as a doctor in the future.\", \"Got one?\": \"Okay. There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school. Number one  I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research. I work in a hematology lab here on campus. Um. I've been working here for about a year already. Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out..\", \"So now  why do you think you deserve this job?\": \"Um. Whether or not something works. And um so I mentioned before also that I work as an EMT so I so beyond having the scientific background  I also have a little bit of clinical background.\", \"Well thank you  thanks for your time.\": \"Um. You know being able to manage patients and to talk to them. And I think that's that's you know  a crucial component of being a doctor as well. But lastly I have a great deal of passion for the medical field. And um I hope that what I what I ultimately learn in medical school will give me I think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field.\", \"Oh well  please tell me a little bit about your background.\": \"Pretty good  how was yours?\", \"So you think you're a leader  tell me why.\": \"Yeah it's  uh  it's been rather pleasant.  I thought it was gonna snow today.\", \"Well  sounds like a (?) situation. So do you consider yourself a team player? Can you tell me of a time when you worked on a team and faced a challenge  how did you go about solving it?\": \"Sure! Uh  so I am an MIT Junior.  Originally  I was  uh  a freshman at Michigan  and then I transferred to  uh  MIT for my sophomore year.\", \"That makes sense  thanks for sharing that.\": \"Um  thank you  I'm studying  uh  Computer Science and  uh  I guess I didn't really get into computer science until last year  um  or last summer  er  the summer before my sophomore year  and then  um  ever since I've more or less committed to it wholly and every minute to.\", \"So  if you had the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be.\": \"Um  I think  in some respects I can be a leader  but I wouldn't say like  in everything I do I'm a leader  so  um  in certain activities that I take part in  I definitely step up to a leadership position in certain situations  but I don't tend to try to be a leader all the time--\", \"Interesting.\": \"So  uh  I guess that was one example of a challenge  uh  that we handle as a team  but um  let's see...Ok  so um  last year I was pledging at my fraternity  and we  one of the activities we do as a pledge  or as pledges  is  um  organize the formal for in the Fall  so uh  we're just given a budget and general guidelines for what a formal should consist of  and then we  we're tasked with setting up everything.  So  um  in this situation  like all the 21 pledges uh  we got together and we allocated tasks and  um  obviously when you have a large event like this with so many people where they get together to bring in  to make it happen  you need to  sort of  uh  there are certain people who won't do their jobs  and so  um  part of what we did was  just  have this sort of setup of accountability where  you know  more or less one pledge would check on another group of pledges to make sure that they were getting their task done  and if they needed to help them out  and so  and this way we try to have somewhat decentralized leadership  but still  um  manage to pull off  yeah.\", \"Thank you for sharing. And now  think of a job that you'd like to have. Anyone in mind?\": \"Oh  definitely! Um\", \"OK. So now  why do you think you should have this job?\": \"Sure  um\", \" So  uhh  please tell me about your background.\": \"Um  let's see  if I could change one thing?\", \" Well  cool.  So  uhh  you think you're a leader  tell me why.\": \"I would probably make myself slightly less of a procrastinator.  I  um  I have a tendency to  like when I have a lot of free time  uh  to  to work on something  I don't get started  I don't make as much headway initially as I probably could or should.  Um  and tend  um  in that respect  leave it  it's more like  my work is more weighted towards the latter half of the deadline  and so  um  I think just in terms of meeting my own goals like  uh  organizations that I get involved with  projects  it  it would just be more productive to  to be working  uh  full speed the entire time.\", \" Uh  very good.  So uhh  do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give an example of a time you were working on a team  and faced some sort of challenge?  How did you resolve it?\": \"Sure.\", \" Mmm-hmm.\": \"Um  ok so  a job that I'd like to have is  uh  software engineering role  at  uh  a tech company or something.  Uh  and um  I think I am a good fit for the job because I have a pretty strong background in computer programming skill sets for this position  um  I've been taking various computer science classes at MIT and engineering classes and learning  uh  the proper was.  Uh not THE proper ways  but  um  good problem solving skills and ways to approach and ways to approach  um  hard problems and  um  that's  I think those are skills that are not difficult  not overly difficult to acquire  but most  many people do not acquire them in  uh  the engineering education.\", \" Well  very good.  So  uhh  if you could change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Oh  good.\", \" And  uhh  now think about a job that you'd like to have.\": \"Um  So  my name is Andre  uh  I come from Finland  I've studied for two years at Cambridge University in England  umm where I did all sorts of engineering for the first two years but I chose to specialize in electrical engineering and information technologies. Um  Currently I'm on an exchange year abroad to MIT doing Course 6. And at MIT I'm specializing in artificial intelligence -- machine learning  (score vector?) machines -- and also device physics and some digital electronics. Um  Specifically in the area of device physics and digital electronics I'm looking at risk processors as well as  um  nanot- um  micro- and nanoscale  uh  semiconductor devices such as transistors  uhh specifically ballistic transistors  which operate at the smallest possible unit.  Em  so yeah. Uhh In the area of AI  I have undertaken  uh  certain competitions  uh  which I have been  uh  lucky to win. Um  in the first one I had to write a simulator where um  I wrote an AI to control a spacecraft which is --\", \" So  uhh  now why should we hire you?\": \"-- supposed to be able to land and take off from Mars. And during that  I had to take into account planetary rotation  gravity  atmospheric effects  uh  aerobraking and all those things  so it was a pretty complex AI  to be able to handle all of that. Um.  Also I undertook a competition  uh  at Cambridge. Uhh in a team of six  we had to build an autonomous robot which was able to navigate a grid and pick up an object and put it in a  in the appropriate box. And there I um was a  a team lead where I managed the team until it did the tasks.  And also I wrote the AI for that.\", \" Well  thank you for interviewing with us today.\": \"Um  I think I have pretty good leadership qualities  umm mainly because I'm able to think uhh on a lo- longer scale  like what has to get accomplished uhh and be able to delegate tasks to people to achieve intermediate goal which will be kind of modular to the achievement of the uhhh long term goal. So for example  in the the  um  robotics project  we had- our  our ultimate goal was to build a chassis  build an electronics  build an AI  and have the robot win this competition. But uhhh we- we didn't go from like scrap metal to that in one go. We had to uh  we had to look at um  specifically first I had to write an AI which was uh  straight - the bit of a AI which was able to follow white lines on a black surface  um  and turn on the- uh  at the junctions of those lines. Um  The electronics guys to that end had to  uh  make some circuits which uhh connect the  um  infrared light form sensors to the kind of main CPU  the arm-core CPU. Umm  So there was some circuit elements involved. And the  uh  mechanics guys had to pretty much just make a test chassis for us  um  but all that took some organizing because they were busy in the workshops  so they didn't have much time to screw arou -- to  uh  play around with  um  . . . you know  other  uh  other things  and the electronics guys had to  um  also schedule the time correctly.\", \"Please tell me about your background. \": \"Um  So one of the challenges in the robotics competition  and this specific team  was that  um  we often had to share resources which were limited among other teams and also among the people in the team.\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was conflict in your team and how you had to resolve it?\": \"uhh  I was a bit of the project lead so I had to give some advice  and also  umm  sort out some technical points with both the electronics and the mechanics teams  and also I had to write my own AI  so I had to kind of balance between the  uh  two and kind of manage my time.  So  what I would try to do was  I would tell them  uh  that we would work out some sort of specific issue  of like sensor connections with the electrical  uh  team  and I would say  Okay guys  so you're going to build this now  and  How long is this going to take? and they would say  I don't know  it's going to take us  uh  a couple hours. And then I would have the time to  maybe for half an hour  go down to the workshop where the mechanical team are playing around  and I would talk to them and see  you know  what they're doing and how- how far apart they want the wheels  or something  uh  for the  you know for the touring to be efficient  or  where do you want the balance  because uh  we faced an  an issue: if we put too much  um  weight on the back of the robot  the robot might tip over. So we try  uhhh we have to  you know  uh  fix that issue. But  uh  once I had the two teams working  uh  I was able to go back and quickly  um  write some code. So the issue was that I needed to kind of give advice from time to time. Umm  and I think I did that by delegating tasks pretty well.\", \"If you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"Um  I think I would try to become more succinct in how I speak and more engaging to people because often I find that umm I come off sometimes a bit geeky or dorky  and some people might not take to that a-- as easily. And --\", \"Why do you think you should get this job?\": \"-- as a team lead  you have to be both inspiring and charismatic. Um  I mean  some uhhh  some great examples  I mean  I guess as a cliche  it's kind of like Steve Jobs  where he's  uh  amazingly inspiring  he's very good at talking to people  but he's also  um  like I wouldn't be able to say that he's kind of more (adducent?) to . . . While at the same time  he is quite  you know  quite the geek being  you know  uh  in charge of Apple  and  you know  thinking about how to play with all these (unintelligible)\", \" How are you doing today? \": \". . . toys. So  striking a balance like that  where you  kind of  you're kind of able to have the fun with the tech  and also be  uh  kind of serious  \", \"Good. Tell me a little more about your background. \": \" um  but not boring-serious  um  so I try to strive towards that direction  uh  if I could.\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Umm because being on the managerial side would allow me to  uh  kind of be able to set the  the direction  uh  in some way  which I enjoy doing  and also  manage the kind of  uh  the sub-teams  and how things will get done. But at the same time  being on the technical side  it's just fun to play around with all this really cool tech  and build it  especially  it's quite rewarding. Um  so I think I have the technical background for the technical part. Um  I've  I've done my programming  I've done my AI - AI courses  my electronics courses  so I  so I know that pretty well. And I have the experience  um  of working in a team and being a team lead  uhh  to know how to manage a small but efficient team.\", \"If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be? \": \"Thank you.\", \"okay  why do you think you should get into graduate school? \": \"Um so I'm obviously not from the States as the accent gives away. I'm from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland. I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond. Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadn't really thought was something appropiate for me. I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones. Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable. So I've spent the last two years um there studying engineering. And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States. So I went for that immediately. Um I've been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering \", \"Hmmm.\": \"A Red Sox game so... Immersing myself in the American culture. Definitely enjoying my time here.\", \"Ahh. Ok. Do you think you're a leader? And tell me why.\": \"Um yes I think that I have the self-confidence to be a leader. I'm someone who's happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and I can't just pass the blame on. Uh I think this is self-evident in positions I've held so far in my univeristy time in the UK where I was on the student council for my college Robinson College in Cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years. Um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections. Obviously my peers think that I'm uh suitable leadership material.\", \"Ok. And  do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"Um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life. And in that I've had um competency rules with school's rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin. Um so I feel I have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and I have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that I don't have. So um I'm humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that I've initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution. You can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the let's leave that for now pile. So yeah I would feel that I'm a good leader.\", \"Ah  good. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"Yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but I think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the UK we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do.\", \"Ok. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"And the queen's husband rather than being king is the Duke of Edinburgh. I'm not sure why he doesn't get to be a king but anyway so there's a scheme called Duke of Edinburgh's Award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds. And there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold. So I've completed all of them. I have the set of the gold. And in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element. Um you go somewhere you haven't been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days. Um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities. If there's flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that. If I come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night. We did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school. We traveled to which is a very nice area naturally. We spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather. One big mission. When we encountered another group they were lost. quite hysterical. They thought they will never be found. We made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area. and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination. To be honest I did quite enjoyed that experience. getting to feel slightly like a hero. That was a time when we had to work as a team. One of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments. They were tired. They weren\\u2019t feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village. The whole expedition is a big example of team work. keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind . encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground . It was massively enjoyable experience. That would have been one major team work experience\", \" Good.  Tell me a little bit more about your background.\": \"I think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you. And as I said before I have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve. I feel that this kind of job is what I will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it. umm I realize it\\u2019s also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me I would be really drawn I get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that I perhaps haven\\u2019t encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person. and it\\u2019s um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction . I can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career. That would be the key reason. um I think I would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success.\", \" Do you think you're a leader?  Tell me why.\": \"Yes.\", \" OK  and do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a time where there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"I'm a student here at MIT  I'm in my third year as a junior  um  and I'm studying chemical biological engineering with a minor in economics. And so  as part of that I've uh taken coursework in transport processes  thermodynamics  chemical biological processes  and things like that. And also some macro  micro  public policy classes with the econ. And then I'm also doing research in chemical engineering laboratory here for a year and a half studying yeast  um  and different ways of doing transcription factors and how they relate then to promoter architecture and the dynamics that are behind that. So  lot of bio chemical engineering complications. And I also did some research this past summer in a systems biology lab in Madrid  Spain  um  so a little more biology related  so  those are most of my technical background.\", \" OK  good.  And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Yeah  so um  I definitely think I'm a leader and that's actually something that's come to define a lot of my time here at MIT is leadership. Um  and so I think I'm a leader both because of the actions I've taken and also the mindset I have and as actions  I guess both of those things are important. So to give an example  um  I'm currently in a position of leadership in a club on campus  our Habitat for Humanity club  um  where I serve as the president of the club and I think I started off as a freshman  um  just participating  I really like community service so I volunteered with them a bit to go help build houses in the Boston/Cambridge area  um  and then I was fairly proactive which led me to start organizing those builds that I was going on  I figured I was benefiting from them  so I wanted to be able to give back and organize them so I ran for the exec of Habitat for Humanity here and started helping organize them  and then from there I went on to wanting to do more  and so now I'm president and run the exec and get to do everything that the club does  and so  um  I think that kind of drive and that desire to move up and give back and contribute and also make things happen definitely is characteristic of a leader. Um  and obviously  the position I'm currently in is one that demands leadership. So I think that's just one illustrative example of why I'm a leader.\", \" And  why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Yeah  um  so I definitely think I'm a team player  um  and I think MIT especially is really conducive to teamwork. Um  but I'll look at a example of team work than relates actually to  um  I'm also involved in leadership within my fraternity. And so  as a part of that  um  we have a five person exec that uh I wasn't on to begin with  but uh  I've now loosened up and wanted to take on more leadership  help out  and so I'm currently on. And so  as a part of that five person exec  um  we've had to do a lot of teamwork. There's five of us  there's uh  my fraternity has seventy people. Um  so it's very large and it requires a lot of working together in order to  um  accomplish really any task. And so I think  um  one illustrative example is we wanted to put on a philanthropy event that I was spearheading in my position. I was doing brotherhood development activities  like a philanthropy even. And so  we haven't really had much precedent  we haven't had an event in a couple of years  um  and so I had come up with a summer with an event based off some stuff for other friends and other schools who I've talked to. Um  and so I had the idea for the event and then I had to work with these other four members to kind of lead the rest of our brotherhood in putting on the event  organizing it  um  and there was a lot challenges because it wasn't  there was no precedent  we hadn't done things like this in the past  um  so we had to work to like motivate people within ourselves to go out and get people to register and participate and things like that. Um  and there's also of course the challenge of then finding others. Um  give us five dollars to participate in our event  why it's of any value  why it matters. And so that duality was really a challenge  as well as of course working amongst ourselves  and so we met those by really laying out very concrete goals  um  and like  doing a lot of brainstorming among the five of us  breaking up  um  to focus on different elements of the problems we would face. Um  and the event ended up being really tremendously successful and then we had a lot of people participate. We met those goals of participation and money raised um  and then were able to have the event again this year and really set a precedent that hadn't existed before  so  it was very successful.\", \" So how are you doing today?\": \"Um  so I think currently  um  what my greatest weakness  and one which I'm working on  is my ability  I talked a lot just now about leadership positions and so they definitely impact me a lot. Right now my ability to successfully delegate  um and the word  I'm not necessarily looking for the word micro-manage  but just truly delegate responsibility  work with another person  and let them be very responsible and communicate with them. I think i struggle there and that's definitely a weakness in my leadership as well as just my general activities because i struggle just to let that person kind of go and foster their own ideas and get their own job done. I'm very quick to step in and assist maybe step on their toes even or at least provide feedback. Sometimes it is warranted and sometimes I think it isn't  and so to be more cognizant of that and to uh be better adept to deal with that I think would be very helpful. And so  I'd love to see that change. It is something I'm working towards and I'm working with people whose leadership I admire  um  who I think do a better job of that then me and try and model myself after them  but currently I do think it's a weakness that I'd like to improve.\", \" Good!  Tell me a little bit about your background.\": \"Okay.\", \" Okay.  Do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"So  for this particular job  um  I think my greatest assets are the combination of skills and experiences that I bring to the table. Um and I think that it'd be very valuable for the position. So I have a very strong technical background  I'm in my third year at MIT studying chemical biological engineering which requires a wide array of very challenging coursework. Um  and I've done research in the field as well  so all of those skills combine to give me a strong technical set of both problem solving and engineering based skills. And then I also have done a lot of work outside of the classroom  both in projects that are academic related and totally not  community services related and things of that nature  um truly develop communication skills  organization skills  um  and the ability to really take a project and get it done. And so I think for this position I will have the technical background to fully understand and wrap my mind around and make goals that I want to accomplish just solve a problem and then these other skills will ensure that not only can I identify a problem  but if I identify a problem I will get it done and I know how to facilitate whatever resources that are available to me to ensure that whatever job gets done well  so I think that will make me a very strong candidate.\", \" Great.  If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Alright. um So  for starters  I am a senior taking an extra semester so you know  half-way through junior year in that sense. I'm a chemical engineer  I'm a rower  light weight rower  not a heavy weight. I have the extra  an extra bonus of having to deal with a weight cap  that sort of thing. Diving in the middle of the year can be fun sometimes. I'm in a fraternity  um it actually recently started up. So I was a founding father of the fraternity  it's Sigma Alpha Epselon. And I've also done very rougly coordinated engineering leadership program. So I'd say those are my main commitments. I had done other things earlier one  I went to Baker and I was very involved in the executive committee there. And I'm also an active member in creating the dining plan that currently exists at MIT. It's got some pros and cons  but it is a good experience so sort of like go door to door and talk to people and really see  let them know what's coming up. THat sort of thing. In general I'd say I'm a pretty active person on campus  pretty well known  um and I do a lot of things to keep myself in shape but also academically stimulated with chemical engineering and whatnot. \", \" Okay.  Why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Very much so. um I guess to start out  being part of the sport sort of creates a natural affinity towards teamwork. Especially with rowing you're depending on other people to be able to accomplish a common goal  there's eight guys in a boat and then there's the person that steers it. And if one person gives up you guys aren't going to win. So that is very much like teamwork  it also coincides with leadership. Rowig doesn't necessarily cultivate leadership  it sort of cultivates like personal dedication and willingness to contribute to the whole. But I feel like I get my leadership experiences from my fraternity. Especially since it started out  I was one of eight people  there was five that was the founding five  that was part of the first pledge class. And when things are starting up everyone needs to take a leadership role and if anyone like cuts any slack it's very likely that the whole ship is going to sink. So right from the get go I was given tons of responsibility and I went with it. I did as much as I could in each of the positions and eventually I came up to the role of  you know  the President. um And in that role I've gotten a lot of praise from the alumni groups and from my students  but generally I feel like I'm a pretty good  I like to work with people  um I can relate to them  and generally pretty sociable  so yeah.\", \"Great. And  you think you're a leader. Tell me why. \": \"I go back and forth with this. When I was younger in middle school  uh I was a lot more modest  I was just generally a quieter person. You know  everyone goes through different phases  through elementary  middle  high school  college  that sort of thing. um And ultimately I turned into someone taht was a lot more sociable  outgoing  that sort of thing. But at times I feel that I can come off as  I hate saying this but I  other people don't say it but sometimes I feel like I may say something and it might be cocky or something of the sort. So one thing I'm really trying to balance is to make sure that I have confidence but it's not overbearing. So I guess  what I'd wanna do right now  like if I could change something  is really try and bring back the modesty because I really respect people that are modest but still able to get a lot of work done. um And  I mean  it's not something that I can't change  it's just something that's really not jibing with my personality right now. So  I'm really  you know  trying to tow the line. But if I could make that switch  I'd at least like to see what kind of a person I'd like to be right now. I guess  I guess I'll leave that answer for now.\", \"Great. So  do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it.\": \"Yeah.\", \"Good. Tell me more about yourself.\": \" Uhh  so I'm uhh  I was born in D.C.  moved to Nigeria when I was seven  umm  came back to America for my junior and senior year of highschool and applied to MIT.  I always wanted to be a mechanical engineer  so it was sort of a straightforward choice for me.  It was always my first choice school  and umm  I was excited to come here and to start learning things.  It just  in the past  it had just been sort of hearing about things but not doing anything or learning about it  which was exciting.  So I'm studying mechanical engineering here now  and umm  I'm concentrating in computer science and electro engineering  which has been a new found interest  I guess.  It's uhh  I'm a junior now  so yeah.\", \"That sounds great. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.\": \" Change one thing about myself...  Uhh  I'd say  like  to...I wish I had a sort of  better background of academics.  Uhh  I didn't go to  like  the best high school.  I didn't  uhh  like  have the best teachers or things like that.  And coming to a place like this and sort of seeing a lot of people who are  I mean  obviously kind of naturally talented  but who have also had good- they've had opportunities to  uhh  show their talent and get better and smarter.  Umm  I wish I could've had that opportunity.  I think I'd be  uhh  even more-  I could do more things than I am doing today.  So  yeah.\", \"And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" Because  uhh  you should hire me for a few reasons.  One  is because my leadership  uhh  abilities  which I've talked a little bit about  umm  a little earlier.  But  also  just my willingness to learn.  Umm  I think  more than the average person  I'm excited to learn new things  umm  and sort of put those things in practice.  And  just as an example  I didn't know anything about computer science before coming to MIT.  But  just uhh  taking just the introductory class  learning about that  I got really interested in that  and so  I'd say that when I don't know a lot of things  or when my experience isn't the best  I'm always willing to learn a lot.  And lastly  I'm a really hard worker.  And so  I'm able to put in the hours and the time and the energy that it takes to  sort of  get a task done.  It's uhh  yeah  I think I'd make a good intern.\", \"Okay. You think you're a leader. Tell me why.\": \"It's a difficult question. I'd probably say my age. I feel like there are a lot of experiences I've missed out on  sort of looking backing at you know  high school  say now that I'm in college or looking back at a first internship once I've done a second. Um  there are a lot of ways I think I could've learned more or matured more as a person had I got into situations with a different mindset. So um I guess what I'm trying to say is if I knowing what I know now will able to go uh redo some of the things of the past year at least which isn't physically possible.\", \"Great. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.\": \"Ok  well as I mentioned before I have a lot of experience  I leadership  I'm a team player but uh beyond that I think I'm just very well qualified and passionate about your company and would be excited to join the team and work with you guys to further your goals.\", \"Great. And why do you think you should get the job?\": \"Uh so I am a biology major at the IT um  Burton of Biology. I'm also getting a minor in chemistry. I'm currently pursuing research on marine micro-biology   specifically Carlson bounds at the Thompson Lab. Um  previously i had worked on arsenic metabolizing simbions in the sponge in Israel  and I hope to continue working on marine-microbes. \", \"Mm okay. Do you think you are leader?  Tell me why.\": \"Uh  i would def say it would be  my self confidence issues. or rather  my ability to speak up and be more  uhm   assertive about my point of view. I've definitely  a lot of times  kept quiet or just like put my views on the back burner  especially I think when i was a fresh coming to a new country it was very difficult to integrate and also like to navigate my way in  so i think i'm still trying to cope with that. \", \"Mmmmm.\": \"I def think i deserve to get into grad school because it's the only thing i want to do - research for me is extremely exciting  and there is a lot. i feel like its the most meaningful way that i can contribute to   uh  the scientific world. and especially in my field. Uuh i def am dedicated to research it's what i want to do for the rest of my life so i hope that i get this opportunity.\", \"Oh okay. Um do you consider yourself a team player.  Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.\": \"I'm good  how are you?\", \"Okay.  If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"So I'm studying mechanical engineering at MIT  and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering...\", \"Hahaha.\": \"...and I've chosen to concentrate on building technology. And on top of that  um I'm double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration. And I'd say two years ago  two summers ago sorry  I interned at Square One Armoring Services  which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government. And I interned with them for two summers  and this was before I really chose the building technology route. I didn't really like the super mechy side of it. This past summer I interned in Barcelona  um  with a company called Ilon(?)  they're a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department. And I really enjoyed the experience. So  I'm going that direction.\", \"Hmm. Okay.\": \"I believe I am a leader. Um  I normally  I wouldn't necessarily run for positions  but when it comes down to someone filling the spot  I will step up  um  and make sure that things get done. I feel that I might be more of a...of an encourager  so to speak...I don't really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try  sort of to like  to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine.\", \"{laughs} Okay.\": \"Um  I'd probably change trying to be a perfectionist. Um  I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things. Um  I think thats something  to sort of  a strange thing to work on  to let things be sometimes  heh.\", \" Good. Tell me more about your background.\": \"I  so  well  I would actually change  even though this is in the past. I would  have a deeper understanding understanding of math. That sounds really strange I know. But  what I consider myself intuitive in general  I understand the concept. I would want to know  what to do  in that situation. But  in other situations  I realize  this is a really into academics. I realize that having a superior understanding of mathematics is so key. \", \"Just in general. Tell me about yourself. \": \" Um.  OK  so I'm a third year linguistics student  umm  I'm  uhh  working on some linguistics research right now and I'm interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad.\", \"Do you think you\\u2019re a leader? Tell me why.\": \" Um.  Yea I think I'm uhh leader.  I think I've fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm I think I've excelled in that role umm.  I've led different group projects in my classes and I've also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm  and I've led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things  so.\", \"Mmmm  ok. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \" OK  umm  so yea I think I work well as a team member  umm  for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes  umm  we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four  umm  and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology  or the sounds of the system  and my partner and I looked at the grammar of the language  and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasn't really following through with his part of the work  umm.  He  I guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and I and asked what she should do about it  cause he wasn't helping out.  And so  the three of us sort of talked about it  and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us. The four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of the...some extra work in putting the two parts together  the phonology and the syntax  to make up for the fact that he hadn't done as much for the original research.  So  that ended up working out well  so.\", \"Right  right  exactly.\": \" Um  I think it would...probably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back.  Um  but I think I've been working to change that.  Um  I've been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that I have problems with because I'm shy.  I've also been trying to get out and meet more people. I've been doing more extracurriculars. And  umm  I volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers  so  that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting.\", \"Ok  great. If you were going to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \" I'm good  how are you?\", \"Uh  huh.\": \" I'm a freshman at MIT here  so I'm studying courses 6 and 18 which is computer science and math.  Umm in high school I did a lot of community work service.  I was the president of our United Way board which is a not for profit.  I did a lot of our school clubs  math teams classic goal. I was captain of a lot of those  and then on campus here part of my sorority Sigma Kappa  the tech. fair which is involved in bringing a lot of companies and students here to showcase their things.\", \"Mm mm.\": \" I think so.  I think umm  I have a little different view of what a leader is.  I think there's definitely one aspect that's very obvious  that you know  you bring everyone to do what you think is best  but I think the most important part of being a leader is incorporate everyone else's ideas.  I think a lot of times some people who are really strong are like natural leaders  but they don't always take the time to make sure everyone else likes what they're doing and they're very straight forward  and they go for it  but I think what makes a really important leader is being able to incorporate everyone else's ideas and find that middle ground that everyone wants to do.\", \"Oh  ok. Why do you think you should get the job?\": \" Definitely  umm I know in high school as a senior last year they gave us a lot of group projects to kind of bring us out of the stereotypical classroom and get ready for uh  a new environment in college and I remember one of our projects it was my group and we were doing something for our econ. class  and it was  we had to like model a situation and do the graphs  and econ's like very straight forward graph wise  there isn't that much to deal with  but my group had like different ideas of how they thought the lines would shift and I remember everyone was just kind of in a panic.  We had to double graph four different scenarios  and no one knew what they wanted to do  and we just had to take them two at a time and I like looked at all of the graphs  and there was some things that were similar  just everyone had a different way of going about it  so I like kind of tried to combine all the ideas and we ended up coming up with a graph that was almost a combination of everyone's  so  it worked out in the end.\", \"Please tell me about your background.\": \" I think I should get this job because I think there's so many opportunities at this company that I'd really like to be a part of.  There's just a lot of chance for growth and a lot of chance also to do something that you love and also make a difference because of it.  I think that the way I deal with problems and working together but also trying to find the best solution and bring people to that level is something that could really benefit the company as well.\", \"Uhum\": \"Hi  I'm good  how are you?\", \"I totally agree. Do you think you are a leader? \": \"Umm  well  I have been going to MIT for four years now  going to graduate this year  umm  I do computer science and I really enjoy it. I really like to play music. I've been involved in several music groups ac-  across campus. I play flute  specifically. Umm  and I grew up on a farm in South Dakota. It's a great place.\", \"Tell me why?\": \"Okay. I'd say that I'm a leader  because  often- First  first of all  in my friend group  and  and any group of people  I generally take the lead  and- For example  where we are going to eat  umm. And  I work in a lab  currently  and I need to direct the project  umm  for writing a  a website to collect music samples from people in Toronto. Umm  and  I'm primarily directing this project and I work with some grad students  and  I make the plans for how its going to work.\", \"Umhum \": \"Okay. Umm  recently I was working  umm  just this last week actually  in a group for my computational biology class. And  we had some struggles dividing the work. It was  it was kind of a difficult thing to  especially since some of us were from a biological background and some of us were from a computational background. Umm  we had a hard time deciding the project so that it was equal work for everyone. So  it was kind of difficult to resolve that  but what we ended up doing was changing our project. Umm  so  I tried to come up with some ways to make sure that everybody had enough  umm  enough work to do based on their backgrounds.\", \" Umhum do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give you an example when there is a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it .\": \"Umm  I think that  I would like to make myself more comfortable  umm  meeting  new people. I think that  that would enrich my life.\", \"Umhum\": \"I think that  I have great background and great experience specifically in the field that  that this job would be for. And  I really enjoy learning new things  and I think that I'm be good at it. And  so  in web programming specifically there's always new technologies coming up and so  I'd be really excited learning how to use those.\", \"That makes sense. If you given  the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?\": \"I'm doing well  thanks. And yourself?\", \"Yes \": \"Well  I'm Zaynab. I am a junior in chemical-- majored in chemical engineering at MIT  but I'm doing a minor in energy studies and a fo-- a concentration in anthropology.\", \"(Snicker}\": \"I think that I am a leader. This is because I've held various leadership positions at college thus far  and I think with my leadership  the groups and the organizations that I've been part of have been able to succeed. For instance  at the moment  I'm the vice president of the African Students Association and the MIT African Students Association as well  a group of 80 students  both international and domestic students.\", \"Uhum Thank you. So why do you think you should get this job?\": \"So  we're more of a social group  where we throw social events  such as like  cultural shows and study breaks  and things like that  just to get the African students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have.\", \" Well thank you for coming today\": \"So I guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show  where we displayed to the entire MIT community just about what it's like to be African like  through-- we did it through performances such as like dancing  singing  spoken word and things like that. And also  other schools from the Boston/Cambridge area like Harvard  Boston University  Wellesley  and so on  they also came  attendance and that was fun.\", \"[inaudible]\": \"I think the time  like  when there was a conflict in my team was  when I was doing this project for one of my classes  which was in my sophomore year. So  there was  like  a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project. \", \"Wonderful. And you think you're a leader. Tell me why.\": \"I have experiences in different companies thus far in my very short academic career  and I think I've been able to work with a variety of people. I would be an asset to any team I'm a part of.\", \"Great. So  do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"So  my background is in mechanical engineering  um  what's  um... and product management  so product development. Uh  basically  what I'm looking to do now is  uh  find a role that combines product management and  uh  communications skills to be with a technical background as well.\", \"OK. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?\": \"Yes  um  so  I think leadership doesn't have to be something that always  uh   done in a formal role. I think leadership is something that you do actively in every part of your life  uh  whether it's taking initiative turning on a light in a dark classroom when no body wants to stand up  something small like that to actually having a formal leadership role  with uh  leading a group and team members. So  I try to always  uh  stay on top of those things. So  take initiative if I'm in a group  scheduling a meeting  whether I have a formal role  um  and be on top of things and  uh  be proactive.\", \"And  uh  why do you think you should get into medical school?\": \"y wanted a system in which they could basically just review comments and posts. It's all from this  uh  inspired by [?]ISawYou which is this website that MIT students  uh  post missed connections on. And you can post and you can comment and people can just read. \", \"So tell me more about your background.\": \" we did was  we just sat down together in a room. Talked about all the options. And really tried to put our  at least I definitely tried to put all my  um  original bias out of the way. Uh  because I knew that we had a huge conflict going on  one of us was going to have to abandon  there was probably a good idea out there somewhere. Um  so  I just put that behind me and really listened to what all my other team members were saying. Um  and  it turned out they had a great idea and we just presented today and the system worked out really well.\", \"Great. And do you think you\\u2019re a leader? Tell me why.\": \"he direction to fit what our users wanted and  uh  came to a solution that we were all really happy with.\", \"Great. And do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?\": \"One thing about myself. That's a tough one. I have a tendency sometimes to take on a lot all at once and not.. I will sometimes get bogged down in all the little details of prioritizing all the small fun things that I have to do and not always taking a step back and focusing on  um  the small picture. But  I'm trying to change that in the way I focus on manage my time  um  really noticing what is it that I'm dedicating my time to  and how can it be better utilized. Or  what is it that is actually should be a priority. Um  and how do I reorganize things. So  I try to do that  um  at least weekly  just look back  you know  what did I do this week  what did I get done  where was I loosing time  what was happening. Um  to try to make  try to  uh  fix that tendency in myself and  um  hope that becomes habit.\", \"Great.

I love what's happening at the company  I'm inspired by the work here. And for me  it's really important that I not only enjoy the work I'm doing  but also the people I'm doing it with. And so far  everyone that I've met  I've loved them. And it's been a really great experience.\", \"OK. And why do you think you should get the job?\": \"I'm doing well  how are you?\", \"Oh  I'm sure. So tell me more about your background. \": \" Yeah I would say that I'm a leader.  I have a lot of leadership positions.  Again the president of my a Capella group and I'm the room assignment chair in my dorm.  So I have to manage people like for the room assignment chair there's an event where I have to make sure that all of the freshman come down to the dining hall at a certain time and then get them to be lead around to the different parts of the dorm.\", \"Great.

Can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?\": \" Yeah so eh I would consider myself a team player.  In my a Capella group often times there are different disagreements about how we want to sing a certain song like whether a certain part should be loud or quiet and we have to discuss it instead of just arguing over the details.  So we've gotten better at figuring out how to settle disputes.\", \"OK. Um  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"Because it's uh it sometimes being self conscious gets in the way because it makes me think twice about doing something and then I hesitate too much and don't do something that I should do.\", \"Uh-huh.

This is not what I understand right now  but last year I sort of could. I\\u2019m in my last semester  as in three classes away from completing my computer science degree.

And  as to why I should get it  and it\\u2019s because I can learn really quickly and um. I believe that I\\u2019m a team player  and um  and try to really fix things. And  I would like to quote one of my professors who said either you\\u2019re building the product  or selling it  or getting in the way. So  I definitely feel that  um  I could be  um  building the product really well  um  and to contribute in general. Positively  with your message. \", \" And why do you think you should get the job.\": \" So I am a Junior at M.I.T  Ah  I am in computer science and I have taken several classes in Algorithms and in [xx]Nessus six \", \"Please tell me about your background\": \" and I am also doing studying on my own machine and I plan on taking that next semester before summer starts umm to develop data analysis and machine running skills . Especially in field of pattern recognition which I am very interest in. And uh I hope that will give me some training for internship that I will do in that field. ah That will give me more practice in the real world \", \"Oh  excellent. So uh  do you think you're a leader? Can you tell me whY?\": \"I think I am.\", \"Mmm  good. So do you consider yourself a team player? Can you tell me a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge? How did you go about resolving it?\": \" I think I am a leader. Ah I have lead several projects in the past ah As in my position as that community service chair and um  and one in my ah fraternity pledge class and the other in my ah in the student group that I am part of. The South Asian American Student Corp and successfully completed. um  Service  projects with the community as well as organizing ah events for ah raising money for charity\", \" Oh excellent. Which house are you?\": \"  ah and also for school projects. I frequently ah I am good at assigning tasks keeping people on task and um as well as gathering input from everybody um which I think are the essential quality of a good leader \", \"Ah  yes  yes I'm familiar with it.\": \"  I do consider myself a team player. Ah Going back to the example of my pledge class from my fraternity. uh we had several tasks. One of which would be to visit every other every student in the pledge class. Storm week  this was during freshman year.\", \"'laugh'\": \"  and with a pledge class has  13 people it is not a impossible task but there were logistical problem. One communication trying to get everybody to participate another is  figuring  out the best way to go about things. People wanting to  meet in the middle ect. So I did my part as a team member to lead people to my room and show up myself. um But a good team player should also make sure that other people are doing their job. ah Not necessarily in a lead or a managerial role. But with the same general properties as a leader ah that all the team members should be checking one another and so I ah pardon that to um when there was several members missing I would ah say hey you call this person and I will call this person. Split up tasks etc. Ah and also help in planning  with what's  the best route to go by etc.\", \"I know  I've been to the house. Um  so if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" If I had to change one thing about myself?\", \" Mm-hmm. There's definitely a thing one can work on  there's definitly a...?  Ok  so think what job you'd like to have. So  why do you think you should get this job?\": \"Naturally there are a lot of thing I wish i could  change about myself. I wish I could do better at basketball.\", \"Oh  excellent. Thank you for interviewing here today.\": \" But ah I think if I had to pick one quality it would probably be my ah  abillity to stay focused on a task  Although I am pretty efficient at ah getting things done and I do create ideas sometimes I get distracted or I like to multitask so I might be staying on task with work in general but I'll like to  have three different homework sessions going on at once and find this one and this. A lot of times that will work really well  for me but if I working collaboratively that may not work best for other people. So making myself more adaptive to other peoples study styles working styles etc  that would probably help me a lot \", \"Excellent  yeah. So  do you think you're a leader? Can you tell me why?\": \" I think I should get this job because ah for two main reasons. One because I would provide a lot the company because I am very efficient at working. I can think creatively for new ideas. Say for new ways to analyse certain new data or to optimize the running of the ah of certain ah software. ah On the other hand. The other reason I should get this job. Is because I would be a valuable member of valuable member of the workplace in this field I think by getting more experience um with this start up I think I would ah Really would  help me with my study skills that would help me in the future \", \"Mm-Hm\": \"Mm-hmm.\", \"Do you think you're a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving that challenge?\": \"Fine  thank you. How about yourself?\", \"Do you consider yourself a team player. Give me an example where there was a conflict on your team that you had to resolve.\": \"So  I'm from Berkley  California.\", \"Mm-hm  well  well  this helps. So  if you were to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \" And I came to MIT to study bioengineering. And it's been a really great education because I've learned to combine like engineering skills  real world skills with all this academic knowledge  um  and especially true in my lab where the combination between hands-on research and like thinking about how the research is working has really come together to improve my understanding of science and medicine.\", \"Now  how about a job you'd like to have?\": \"d of the Greek MedLinks  uh  I really try and encourage people in their fraternities and sororities to  uh   get involve with their  the people that they assess and teach them a lot about nutrition and health. And then I organize inter-Greek MedLinks events. So this has really improved my leadership because it helped me learn to do organizational skills and really learn to listen to feedback because you can't lead people that don't want to be led.\", \"Good. So  now  why should we give you this job?\": \"Sure. So  I think team work is...the only way to get anything done...right  an individual  what are you going to do? Um  so  I played on the golf team in high school. And we're a close-knit team. But golf is a mental game and sometimes it can get to your head if you're not playing well  and you just play worse. And it's a downward spiral. And you're with someone out on the course for five hours. And if you have like a little feud between each other  you're still going to be stuck with that person for five hours. \", \"Well thank you. I appreciate you coming to interview today.\": \"I have trouble with like little menial deadlines and all this writing and signatures and getting everything organized. It stresses me out. But I'm learning to deal with it by electronics...ah! The new age! It is my savior.\", \"Please talk about yourself.\": \" the new iMac and iPhone and the way they interconnect means that if I have to do something  there's going to be like six alarms that are going to go and remind me. And so with my computer and my phone so if I can't hear one  I can probably  probably would [inaudible] the other. So  that's really helped. It helped relieve the stress. Knowing that I'm going to be reminded is almost enough to take my mind off of it so I can focus on what I'm doing.\", \"Of course  same person.\": \"Well  I think I should go to medical school because I love people  and I love to help  and I've got the academic background for it. I'm not afraid to work hard and put in long hours. Medicine is fascinating surrounded by all these diseases that...I mean we've made such great progress  but there's just more that we can study. So  I'm currently studying in my lab  uh  work in an HIV lab. And that really inspired me to go into medicine because  you know  I'm looking at all these cutting-edge technologies and it's like I want to be right where they're being implemented  not just on the research side but on the people side as well.\", \"Thank you  so uh do you think you\\u2019re a leader and tell me why.\": \"Um  I am a sophomore at MIT. Um  I'm studying brain and cognitive science  with a minor in biology. Right now I\\u2019m working in a lab that is more of a narrow cognition lab. We work  um  basically to try to figure out pathways in the brain that process different functions. Um  it\\u2019s a longitudinal study. Um  so it\\u2019s something I\\u2019m really interested in. But I think moving forward I\\u2019m going to try to start working with from a pharmacology aspect  because it\\u2019s such an emerging field. Um  that\\u2019s mainly where I want to go  because I hope to eventually work  um  in [??]  and so pharmacology would be very important for that field.\", \"Leader.\": \"I think I am a leader  in a sense that I see people as people  and I see tasks as tasks  and I know how to communicate effectively between how to get these tasks done and how to get the people to do them. And I think I\\u2019m a good motivator  good communicator  and I\\u2019m also very detail-oriented. So it helps me better able to break down  um  people in order to delegate  um  more fundamentals or specific tasks  in order to get them done more effectively.\", \"Good do you think you\\u2019re a team player? Can you tell me about a time when you worked on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you solve it?\": \"Yes  I consider myself a team player  because I do think I\\u2019m very fair and always open to what other people are thinking. So in [??] movement  which is an on-campus student group which basically seeks to provide inner city Boston high school students with better access to reading and math comprehension to help better prepare them for the SAT test. We meet with three or four of them once a week on a Sunday. And large groups  so they\\u2019re  like  small groups that two members are on a charter. So I\\u2019m part of a two-person team  and then we all meet together. So I would sometimes disagree with my partner as well as the [??] as a whole in terms of what we should be teaching and what we should be focusing on  whether we should look more at science  whether we should have more holistic education versus just teaching to the SAT. I think that basically what I was trying to do was explain my point. If the group thought that what I was saying had some merit and liked to incorporate it I would feel good. But if they didn\\u2019t  then I would accept the fact that that was the way they felt; and  you know  majority rules and I didn\\u2019t have any hard feelings. At the end of the day I wanted what\\u2019s best for the kids. So in a sense I am a team player because I want what\\u2019s best for the project as a whole. It\\u2019s not just all about me and getting my point across.\", \"Wonderful  thanks for sharing that. If you could change one thing about yourself  what would it be?\": \"I definitely think it would be making myself more organized. So I\\u2019m extremely detail-oriented  and I see exactly what needs to be done and the timeline it needs to get done. But I guess since I\\u2019m involved in so many things  being a student  as well as in a sorority  as well as pursuing various academic endeavors  I think that  um  sometimes that bogs me down. Knowing exactly what I need to get done and what timeline  and then I get overstretched. But I think that\\u2019s an easy problem to fix. Um  and so far as we  you know  you get more specialized over the course of our lives. I definitely have a path that is more specialized that I intend to pursue. So that won\\u2019t be a problem  and I think just maintaining basic organizational structure definitely helps me  but it would be a lot easier if I didn\\u2019t have to maintain anything and that was just naturally the way I was  so...\", \"You can\\u2019t change your height though so what could you change?\": \"I think that I have\\u2026 I\\u2019m very interested in what your company is doing  and I\\u2019m very interested in what this project specifically is related to  but I also think I have a lot to offer the group as well. I am a MIT student who\\u2019s given a very specific set of problems and some solving skills that would be very unique to the group. But I\\u2019m also very outgoing and very interested in interpersonal relationships and I think that could help me convey our message as well as work with the technical aspect of the team.\", \"Good  so now think of a job that you\\u2019d like to have. So  one in mind?\": \"Um  pretty good  pretty good. Getting busy with studying for finals. \", \"Good. So why do you think we should hire you for this job.\": \"Um  alright  so  I  I've been studying at MIT for three years. I initially started as a physics major actually  so sophomore year I took  um  a couple physics classes in relativity  um  waves and vibrations. Uh  and then one of the classes that had been recommended to me was computational neuroscience  which also counts for physics department. So  um  after that was intro to neuroscience. So I took that  fell in love with neuroscience and cognitive neuroscience  so... I started taking more classes in that.\", \"Thanks  Steven. Thank you for coming here today.\": \"Um  I'm working on it  um  definitely. Uh  I mean  I do  I do like working in a team as equal group members  um  I feel like I can be a leader. Uh  for example  this past summer I was in China  and  uh  they let me  uh  teach a classroom of 60 students. Um  and so that really help to strengthen my leadership skills  just in terms of classroom management and getting everyone to work together as a group.\"}"
